<h2>PREFACE,</h2>

<h4><i>BY S. CROXALL</i>.</h4>


<p>So much has been already said concerning Æsop and
his writings, both by ancient and modern authors, that
the subject seems to be quite exhausted. The different
conjectures, opinions, traditions, and forgeries, which
from time to time we have had given to us of him, would
fill a large volume: but they are, for the most part, so
inconsistent and absurd, that it would be but a dull amusement
for the reader to be led into such a maze of uncertainty:
since Herodotus, the most ancient Greek historian,
did not flourish till near an hundred years after Æsop.</p>

<p>As for his Life, with which we are entertained in so complete
a manner, before most of the editions of his Fables, it
was invented by one Maximus Planudes, a Greek Monk;
and, if we may judge of him from that composition, just as
judicious and learned a person, as the rest of his fraternity
are at this day observed to be. Sure there never were so
many blunders and childish dreams mixed up together, as
are to be met with in the short compass of that piece. For
a Monk, he might be very good and wise, but in point of
history and chronology, he shows himself to be very ignorant.
He brings Æsop to Babylon, in the reign of king
Lycerus, a king of his own making; for his name is not
to be found in any catalogue, from Nabonassar to Alexander
the Great; Nabonadius, most probably, reigning in
Babylon about that time. He sends him into Egypt in the
days of Nectanebo, who was not in being till two hundred
years afterwards; with some other gross mistakes of that
kind, which sufficiently show us that this Life was a
work of invention, and that the inventor was a bungling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
poor creature. He never mentions Æsop's being at Athens;
though Phædrus speaks of him as one that lived the greatest
part of his time there; and it appears that he had a
statue erected in that city to his memory, done by the hand
of the famed Lysippus. He writes of him as living at
Samos, and interesting himself in a public capacity in the
administration of the affairs of that place; yet, takes not
the least notice of the Fable which Aristotle<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> tells us he
spoke in behalf of a famous Demagogue there, when he
was impeached for embezzling the public money; nor does
he indeed give us the least hint of such a circumstance.
An ingenious man might have laid together all the materials
of this kind that are to be found in good old authors, and,
by the help of a bright invention, connected and worked
them up with success; we might have swallowed such an
imposition well enough, because we should not have known
how to contradict it: but in Planudes' case, the imposture
is doubly discovered; first, as he has the unquestioned
authority of antiquity against him; secondly, (and if the
other did not condemn him) as he has introduced the witty,
discreet, judicious Æsop, quibbling in a strain of low
monastic waggery, and as archly dull as a Mountebank's
Jester.</p>

<p>That there was a Life of Æsop, either written or traditionary,
before Aristotle's time, is pretty plain; and that
there was something of that kind extant in Augustus' reign,
is, I think, as undoubted; since Phædrus mentions many
transactions of his, during his abode at Athens. But it is as
certain, that Planudes met with nothing of this kind; or,
at least, that he met not with the accounts with which they
were furnished, because of the omissions before-mentioned;
and consequently with none so authentic and good. He
seems to have thrown together some merry conceits which
occurred to him in the course of his reading, such as he
thought were worthy of Æsop, and very confidently obtrudes
them upon us for his. But, when at last he brings
him to Delphos (where he was put to death by being thrown
down from a precipice) that the Delphians might have
some colour of justice for what they intended to do, he
favours them with the same stratagem which Joseph made
use of to bring back his brother Benjamin; they clandestinely
convey a cup into his baggage, overtake him upon
the road, after a strict search find him guilty; upon that
pretence carry him back to the city, condemn and execute
him.</p>

<p>As I would neither impose upon others, nor be imposed
upon, I cannot, as some have done, let such stuff as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
pass for the Life of the great Æsop. Planudes has little
authority for any thing he has delivered concerning him;
nay, as far as I can find, his whole account, from the
beginning to the end, is mere invention, excepting some
few circumstances; such as the place of his birth, and of
his death; for in respect of the time in which he lived, he
has blundered egregiously, by mentioning some incidents
as contemporary with Æsop, which were far enough from
being so. Xanthus, his supposed master, puts his wife into
a passion, by bringing such a piece of deformity into her
house, as our Author is described to be. Upon this, the
master reproaches the slave for not uttering something
witty, at a time that seemed to require it so much: and
then Æsop comes out, slap dash, with a satirical reflection
upon women, taken from Euripides, the famous Greek
tragedian. Now Euripides happened not to be born till
about fourscore years after Æsop's death. What credit,
therefore, can be given to any thing Planudes says of him?</p>

<p>As to the place of his birth, I will allow, with the generality
of those who have written about him, that it might
have been some town in Phrygia Major: A. Gellius making
mention of him, says, 'Æsopus ille, e Phrygia, Fabulator.'
That he was also by condition a slave, we may
conclude from what Phædrus<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> relates of him. But
whether at both Samos and Athens, he does not particularly
mention: though I am inclined to think it was at the
latter only; because he often speaks of him as living at
that place, and never at any other; which looks as if
Phædrus believed that he had never lived any where else.
Nor do I see how he could help being of that opinion, if
others of the ancients, whose credit is equally good, did
not carry him into other places. Aristotle introduces him
(as I mentioned before) speaking in public to the Samians,
upon the occasion of their Demagogue, or Prime Minister,
being impeached for plundering the commonwealth.</p>

<p>I cannot but think Æsop was something above the
degree of a slave, when he made such a figure as an
eminent speaker in the Samian State. Perhaps he might
have been in that low condition in the former part of his
life; and therefore Phædrus, who had been of the same
rank himself, might love to enlarge upon this circumstance,
since he does not choose to represent him in any
higher sphere. Unless we allow him to be speaking<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in
as public a capacity to the Athenians, upon the occasion
of Pisistratus' seizing their liberties, as we have before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
supposed he did to the Samians. But, however, granting
that he was once a slave, we have great authority that he
was afterwards not only free, but in high veneration and
esteem with all that knew him; especially all that were
eminent for wisdom and virtue. Plutarch, in his Banquet
of the Seven Wise Men, among several other illustrious
persons, celebrated for their wit and knowledge, introduces
Æsop. And, though in one place he seems to be
ridiculed by one of the company for being of a clumsy
mongrel shape; yet, in general, he is represented as very
courtly and polite in his behaviour. He rallies Solon,
and the rest, for taking too much liberty in prescribing
rules for the conduct of sovereign princes; putting them
in mind, that those who aspire to be the friends and counsellors
of such, lose that character, and carry matters too
far when they proceed to censure and find fault with them.
Upon the credit of Plutarch, likewise, we fix the Life of
Æsop in the time of Cr&oelig;sus, King of Lydia; with whom
he was in such esteem, as to be deputed by him to consult
the Oracle at Delphos, and be sent as his envoy to Periander,
King of Corinth; which was about three hundred
and twenty years after the time in which Homer lived,
and five hundred and fifty before Christ.</p>

<p>Now, though this imaginary banquet of Plutarch does
not carry with it the weight of a serious history, yet we
may take it for granted, that he introduced nothing in his
fictitious scene, which might contradict either the written
or traditionary Life of Æsop; but rather chose to make
every thing agree with it. Be that as it will, this is the
sum of the account which we have to give of him. Nor,
indeed, is it material for us to know the little trifling circumstances
of his Life; as whether he lived at Samos or
Athens, whether he was a slave or a freeman, whether
handsome or ugly. He has left us a legacy in his writings
that will preserve his memory dear and perpetual among
us: what we have to do, therefore, is to show ourselves
worthy of so valuable a present, and to act, in all respects,
as near as we can to the will and intention of the donor.
They who are governed by reason, need no other motive
than the mere goodness of a thing to incite them to the
practice of it. But men, for the most part, are so superficial
in their inquiries, that they take all upon trust; and
have no taste for any thing but what is supported by the
vogue of others, and which it is inconsistent with the
fashion of the world not to admire.</p>

<p>As an inducement, therefore, to such as these to like the
person and conversation of Æsop, I must assure them that
he was held in great esteem by most of the great wits of
old. There is scarce an author among the ancient Greeks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
who mixed any thing of morality in his writings, but
either quotes or mentions him.</p>

<p>Whatever his person was, the beauties of his mind were
very charming and engaging; that the most celebrated
among the ancients were his admirers; that they speak
of him with raptures, and pay as great a respect to him
as to any of the other wise men who lived in the same
age. Nor can I perceive, from any author of antiquity,
that he was so deformed as the Monk has represented
him. If he had, he must have been so monstrous and
shocking to the eye, as not only to be a very improper
envoy for a great king, but scarce fit to be admitted as a
slave in any private family. Indeed, from what Plutarch
hints of him, I suspect he had something particular in his
mien; but rather odd than ugly, and more apt to excite
mirth than disgust, in those that conversed with him.
Perhaps something humorous displayed itself in his countenance
as well as his writings; and it might be upon
account of both, that he got the name of &#915;&#949;&#955;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#962;, as
Lucian calls him, and his works that of &#915;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#945;. However,
we will go a middle way; and without insisting
upon his beauty, or giving into his deformity, allow him
to have made a merry comical figure; at least as handsome
as Socrates; but at the same time conclude, that this
particularity in the frame of his body was so far from
being of any disadvantage to him, that it gave a mirthful
cast to every thing he said, and added a kind of poignancy
to his conversation.</p>

<p>We have seen what opinion the ancients had of our
Author, and his writings. Now, as to the manner of conveying
instruction by Fables in general, though many
good vouchers of antiquity sufficiently recommend it, yet
to avoid tiring the reader's patience, I shall wave all
quotations from thence, and lay before him the testimony
of a modern; whose authority, in point of judgment, and
consequently, in the present case, may be as readily acknowledged
as that of any ancient of them all. "Fables<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>,"
says Mr. Addison, "were the first pieces of wit that
made their appearance in the world; and have been still
highly valued, not only in times of the greatest simplicity,
but among the most polite ages of mankind. Jotham's
Fable of the Trees is the oldest that is extant, and as
beautiful as any which have been made since that time.
Nathan's Fable of the poor Man and his Lamb, is likewise
more ancient than any that is extant, besides the
above-mentioned, and had so good an effect, as to convey
instruction to the ear of a king, without offending it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
to bring the man after God's own heart to a right sense
of his guilt, and his duty. We find Æsop in the most
distant ages of Greece. And, if we look into the very
beginning of the commonwealth of Rome, we see a
mutiny among the common people appeased by the
Fable of the Belly and the Members<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; which was indeed
very proper to gain the attention of an incensed rabble,
at a time, when, perhaps, they would have torn to pieces
any man who had preached the same doctrine to them,
in an open and direct manner. As Fables took their
birth in the very infancy of learning, they never flourished
more than when learning was at its greatest height.
To justify this assertion, I shall put my reader in mind
of Horace, the greatest wit and critic in the Augustan
age; and of Boileau, the most correct poet among the
moderns; not to mention La Fontaine, who, by this way
of writing, is come more into vogue than any other
author of our times." After this, he proceeds to give some
account of that kind of Fable in which the passions, and
other imaginary beings, are actors; and concludes with a
most beautiful one of that sort, of his own contriving.
In another place, he gives us a translation from Homer
of that inimitable Fable comprised in the interview between
Jupiter and Juno, when the latter made use of the
girdle of Venus, to recall the affection of her husband; a
piece never sufficiently to be recommended to the perusal
of such of the fair sex, as are ambitious of acquitting
themselves handsomely in point of conjugal complacence.
But I must not omit the excellent Preface, by which the
Fable is introduced, "Reading is to the mind<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>," says he,
"what exercise is to the body: as by the one, health is
preserved, strengthened, and invigorated; by the other
virtue (which is the health of the mind) is kept alive,
cherished, and confirmed. But, as exercise becomes
tedious and painful when we make use of it only as the
means of health, so reading is too apt to grow uneasy
and burdensome, when we apply ourselves to it only for
our improvement in virtue. For this reason, the virtue
which we gather from a Fable or an allegory, is like the
health we get by hunting, as we are engaged in an agreeable
pursuit that draws us on with pleasure, and makes
its insensible of the fatigues that accompany it."</p>

</div>


<p>A brisk young Cock, in company with two or
three pullets, his mistresses, raking upon a dunghill
for something to entertain them with, happened
to scratch up a Jewel. He knew what it was well
enough, for it sparkled with an exceeding bright
lustre; but, not knowing what to do with it,
endeavoured to cover his ignorance under a gay
contempt; so, shrugging up his wings, shaking
his head, and putting on a grimace, he expressed
himself to this purpose:&mdash;'Indeed, you are a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
fine thing; but I know not any business you have
here. I make no scruple of declaring that my
taste lies quite another way; and I had rather
have one grain of dear delicious barley, than all
the Jewels under the sun.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>There are several people in the world that pass,
with some, for well accomplished gentlemen, and
very pretty fellows, though they are as great
strangers to the true uses of virtue and knowledge
as the Cock upon the dunghill is to the real value
of the Jewel. He palliates his ignorance by pretending
that his taste lies another way. But,
whatever gallant airs people may give themselves
upon these occasions, without dispute, the solid
advantages of virtue, and the durable pleasures of
learning, are as much to be preferred before other
objects of the senses, as the finest brilliant diamond
is above a barley-corn. The greatest blockheads
would appear to understand what at the same time
they affect to despise: and nobody yet was ever
so vicious, as to have the impudence to declare,
in public, that virtue was not a fine thing.</p>

<p>But still, among the idle, sauntering young fellows
of the age, who have leisure as well to cultivate
and improve the faculties of the mind, as to
dress and embellish the body, how many are there
who spend their days in raking after new scenes
of debauchery, in comparison of those few who
know how to relish more reasonable entertainments!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Honest, undesigning good sense is so
unfashionable, that he must be a bold man who,
at this time of day, attempts to bring it into
esteem.</p>

<p>How disappointed is the youth who, in the
midst of his amorous pursuits, endeavouring to
plunder an outside of bloom and beauty, finds a
treasure of impenetrable virtue concealed within!
And why may it not be said, how delighted are
the fair sex when, from among a crowd of empty,
frolic, conceited admirers, they find out, and distinguish
with their good opinion, a man of sense,
with a plain, unaffected person, which, at first
sight, they did not like!</p>

<span class="caption">THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.</span>
</div>


<p>One hot, sultry day, a Wolf and a Lamb happened
to come, just at the same time, to quench
their thirst in the stream of a clear, silver brook
that ran tumbling down the side of a rocky mountain.
The Wolf stood upon the higher ground,
and the Lamb at some distance from him down
the current. However, the Wolf, having a mind
to pick a quarrel with him, asked him, what he
meant by disturbing the water, and making it so
muddy that he could not drink? and, at the same
time demanded satisfaction. The Lamb, frightened
at this threatening charge, told him, in a
tone as mild as possible, that, with humble submission,
he could not conceive how that could be;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
since the water which he drank, ran down from
the Wolf to him, and therefore it could not be
disturbed so far up the stream. 'Be that as it will,'
replies the Wolf, 'you are a rascal, and I have
been told that you treated me with ill language,
behind my back, about half a year ago.'&mdash;'Upon
my word,' says the Lamb, 'the time you mention
was before I was born.' The Wolf, finding it to
no purpose to argue any longer against truth, fell
into a great passion, snarling and foaming at the
mouth, as if he had been mad; and drawing
nearer to the Lamb, 'Sirrah,' says he, 'if it was
not you, it was your father, and that is all one.'&mdash;So
he seized the poor innocent, helpless thing,
tore it to pieces, and made a meal of it.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>The thing which is pointed at in this fable is
so obvious, that it will be impertinent to multiply
words about it. When a cruel ill-natured man
has a mind to abuse one inferior to himself, either
in power or courage, though he has not given the
least occasion for it, how does he resemble the
Wolf! whose envious, rapacious temper could
not bear to see innocence live quietly in its neighbourhood.
In short, wherever ill people are in
power, innocence and integrity are sure to be
persecuted: the more vicious the community is,
the better countenance they have for their own
villanous measures. To practise honesty in bad
times, is being liable to suspicion enough; but if
any one should dare to prescribe it, it is ten to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
one but he would be impeached of high crimes
and misdemeanors: for to stand up for justice in
a degenerate and corrupt state, is tacitly to upbraid
the government, and seldom fails of pulling
down vengeance upon the head of him that offers
to stir in its defence. Where cruelty and malice
are in combination with power, nothing is so easy
as for them to find a pretence to tyrannize over
innocence, and exercise all manner of injustice.</p>

<span class="caption">THE LION AND THE FOUR BULLS.</span>
</div>


<p>Four Bulls, which had entered into a very
strict friendship, kept always near one another,
and fed together. The Lion often saw them, and
as often had a mind to make one of them his prey;
but, though he could easily have subdued any of
them singly, yet he was afraid to attack the whole
alliance, as knowing they would have been too
hard for him, and therefore contented himself,
for the present, with keeping at a distance. At
last, perceiving no attempt was to be made upon
them, as long as this combination held, he took
occasion, by whispers and hints, to foment jealousies,
and raise divisions among them. This
stratagem succeeded so well, that the Bulls grew
cold and reserved towards one another, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
soon after ripened into a downright hatred and
aversion; and, at last, ended in a total separation.
The Lion had now obtained his ends; and, as
impossible as it was for him to hurt them while
they were united, he found no difficulty, now
they were parted, to seize and devour every Bull
of them, one after another.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>The moral of this fable is so well known and
allowed, that to go about to enlighten it, would
be like holding a candle to the sun. "A kingdom
divided against itself cannot stand;" and as undisputed
a maxim as it is, was, however, thought
necessary to be urged to the attention of mankind,
by the best Man that ever lived. And since
friendships and alliances are of so great importance
to our well-being and happiness, we cannot
be too often cautioned not to let them be broken
by tale-bearers and whisperers, or any other contrivance
of our enemies.</p>

<span class="caption">THE FROG AND THE FOX.</span>
</div>


<p>A Frog, leaping out of a lake, and taking the
advantage of a rising ground, made proclamation
to all the beasts of the forest, that he was an able
physician, and, for curing all manner of distempers,
would turn his back to no person living.
This discourse, uttered in a parcel of hard, cramp
words, which nobody understood, made the beasts
admire his learning, and give credit to every
thing he said. At last the Fox, who was present,
with indignation asked him, how he could have
the impudence, with those thin lantern-jaws, that
meagre pale phiz, and blotched spotted body, to
set up for one who was able to cure the infirmities
of others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>A sickly, infirm look, is as disadvantageous in
a physician, as that of a rake in a clergyman, or a
sheepish one in a soldier. If this moral contains
any thing further, it is, that we should not set up
for rectifying enormities in others, while we labour
under the same ourselves. Good advice ought
always to be followed, without our being prejudiced
upon account of the person from whom it
comes: but it is seldom that men can be brought
to think us worth minding, when we prescribe
cures for maladies with which ourselves are infected.
"Physician, heal thyself," is too scriptural
not to be applied upon such an occasion;
and, if we would avoid being the jest of an audience,
we must be sound, and free from those
diseases of which we would endeavour to cure
others. How shocked must people have been to
hear a preacher, for a whole hour, declaim against
drunkenness, when his own infirmity has been
such, that he could neither bear nor forbear
drinking; and, perhaps, was the only person in
the congregation who made the doctrine at that
time necessary! Others too have been very zealous
in exploding crimes, for which none were
more suspected than themselves: but let such
silly hypocrites remember, that they whose eyes
want couching, are the most improper people in
the world to set up for oculists.</p>

<p>An Ass was loaded with good provisions of
several sorts, which, in time of harvest, he was
carrying into the field for his master and the
reapers to dine upon. By the way he met with a
fine large Thistle, and, being very hungry, began
to mumble it; which, while he was doing, he
entered into this reflection&mdash;'How many greedy
epicures would think themselves happy, amidst
such a variety of delicate viands as I now carry!
But to me, this bitter prickly Thistle is more
savoury and relishing than the most exquisite
and sumptuous banquet.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Happiness and misery, and oftentimes pleasure
and pain, exist merely in our opinion, and are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
more to be accounted for than the difference of
tastes. "That which is one man's meat, is another
man's poison," is a proposition that ought to be
allowed in all particulars, where the opinion is
concerned, as well as in eating and drinking.
Our senses must inform us whether a thing pleases
or displeases, before we can declare our judgment
of it; and that is to any man good or evil, which
his own understanding suggests to him to be so,
and not that which is agreeable to another's fancy.
And yet, as reasonable and as necessary as it is to
grant this, how apt are we to wonder at people
for not liking this or that, or how can they think
so and so! This childish humour of wondering at
the different tastes and opinions of others, occasions
much uneasiness among the generality of
mankind. But, if we considered things rightly,
why should we be more concerned at others differing
from us in their way of thinking upon any
subject whatever, than at their liking cheese, or
mustard; one, or both of which, we may happen
to dislike? In truth, he that expects all mankind
should be of his opinion, is much more stupid
and unreasonable than the Ass in the fable.</p>

lest the reapers should come to reap it before her
young brood were fledged, and able to remove
from the place: wherefore, upon flying abroad to
look for food, she left this charge with them&mdash;that
they should take notice what they heard
talked of in her absence, and tell her of it when
she came back again. When she was gone, they
heard the owner of the corn call to his son&mdash;'Well,'
says he, 'I think this corn is ripe enough;
I would have you go early to-morrow, and desire
our friends and neighbours to come and help us
to reap it.' When the Old Lark came home, the
Young Ones fell a quivering and chirping round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
her, and told her what had happened, begging
her to remove them as fast as she could. The
mother bid them be easy; 'for,' says she, 'if the
owner depends upon friends and neighbours, I am
pretty sure the corn will not be reaped to-morrow.'
Next day she went out again, upon the same occasion,
and left the same orders with them as before.
The owner came, and stayed, expecting those he
had sent to: but the sun grew hot, and nothing was
done, for not a soul came to help him. 'Then,'
says he to his son, 'I perceive these friends of ours
are not to be depended upon; so that you must even
go to your uncles and cousins, and tell them, I desire
they would be here betimes to-morrow morning
to help us to reap.' Well, this the Young
Ones, in a great fright, reported also to their
mother. 'If that be all,' says she, 'do not be frightened,
children, for kindred and relations do not
use to be so very forward to serve one another;
but take particular notice what you hear said the
next time, and be sure you let me know it.' She
went abroad the next day, as usual; and the owner,
finding his relations as slack as the rest of his
neighbours, said to his son, 'Hark ye! George,
do you get a couple of good sickles ready against
to-morrow morning, and we will even reap the
corn ourselves.' When the Young Ones told their
mother this, 'Then,' says she, 'we must be gone
indeed; for, when a man undertakes to do his
business himself, it is not so likely that he will be
disappointed.' So she removed her Young Ones
immediately, and the corn was reaped the next
day by the good man and his son.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Never depend upon the assistance of friends
and relations in any thing which you are able to
do yourself; for nothing is more fickle and uncertain.
The man, who relies upon another for the
execution of any affair of importance, is not only
kept in a wretched and slavish suspense while he
expects the issue of the matter, but generally meets
with a disappointment. While he, who lays the
chief stress of his business upon himself, and
depends upon his own industry and attention for
the success of his affairs, is in the fairest way to
attain his end: and, if at last he should miscarry,
has this to comfort him&mdash;that it was not through
his own negligence, and a vain expectation of the
assistance of friends. To stand by ourselves, as
much as possible, to exert our own strength and
vigilance in the prosecution of our affairs, is god-like,
being the result of a most noble and highly
exalted reason; but they who procrastinate and
defer the business of life by an idle dependance
upon others, in things which it is in their own
power to effect, sink down into a kind of stupid
abject slavery, and show themselves unworthy of
the talents with which human nature is dignified.</p>

<p>The Fox, passing early one summer's morning
near a farm-yard, was caught in a springe, which
the farmer had planted there for that end. The
Cock, at a distance, saw what happened; and,
hardly yet daring to trust himself too near so
dangerous a foe, approached him cautiously, and
peeped at him, not without some horror and dread
of mind. Reynard no sooner perceived it, but
he addressed himself to him, with all the designing
artifice imaginable. 'Dear cousin,' says he, 'you
see what an unfortunate accident has befallen me
here, and all upon your account: for, as I was
creeping through yonder hedge, in my way homeward,
I heard you crow, and was resolved to ask
you how you did before I went any further: but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
by the way, I met with this disaster; and therefore
now I must become an humble suitor to you for a
knife to cut this plaguy string; or, at least, that
you would conceal my misfortune, till I have
gnawed it asunder with my teeth.' The Cock,
seeing how the case stood, made no reply, but
posted away as fast as he could, and gave the
farmer an account of the whole matter; who,
taking a good weapon along with him, came and
did the Fox's business, before he could have time
to contrive his escape.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Though there is no quality of the mind more
graceful in itself, or that renders it more amiable
to others, than the having a tender regard to those
who are in distress; yet we may err, even in this
point, unless we take care to let our compassion
flow out upon proper objects only. When the
innocent fall into misfortune, it is the part of a
generous brave spirit to contribute to their redemption;
or, if that be impossible, to administer
something to their comfort and support. But,
when wicked men, who have been enemies to
their fellow-subjects, are entrapped in their own
pernicious schemes, he that labours to deliver
them, makes himself an associate in their crimes,
and becomes as great an enemy to the public as
those whom he would screen and protect.</p>

they that grieve for them, and would be glad to
rescue them from the rope? Not honest men, we

would, perhaps, commiserate their condition, and
be ready to mutiny in their favour: nay, the rascally
solicitor, who had been employed upon their

had succeeded no better, and be afraid of losing
his reputation, among other delinquents, for the
future: but every friend to justice would have no
reason to be dissatisfied at any thing but a mournful
reflection, which he could not forbear making,

<p>A Fox having fallen into a Well, made a shift,
by sticking his claws into the sides, to keep his
head above water. Soon after, a Wolf came
and peeped over the brink; to whom the Fox
applied himself very earnestly for assistance:
entreating, that he would help him to a rope, or
something of that kind, which might favour his
escape. The Wolf, moved with compassion at
his misfortune, could not forbear expressing his
concern: 'Ah! poor Reynard,' says he, 'I am
sorry for you with all my heart; how could you
possibly come into this melancholy condition?'&mdash;'Nay,
prithee, friend,' replies the Fox, 'if you
wish me well, do not stand pitying of me, but lend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
me some succour as fast as you can: for pity is
but cold comfort when one is up to the chin in
water, and within a hair's breadth of starving or
drowning.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Pity, indeed, is of itself but poor comfort at
any time; and, unless it produces something
more substantial, is rather impertinently troublesome,
than any way agreeable. To stand bemoaning
the misfortunes of our friends, without
offering some expedient to alleviate them, is only
echoing to their grief, and putting them in mind
that they are miserable. He is truly my friend
who, with a ready presence of mind, supports
me; not he who condoles with me upon my ill
success, and says he is sorry for my loss. In
short, a favour or obligation is doubled by being
well-timed; and he is the best benefactor, who
knows our necessities, and complies with our
wishes, even before we ask him.</p>

<p>The Wolves and the Sheep had been a long
time in a state of war together. At last a cessation
of arms was proposed, in order to a treaty of
peace, and hostages were to be delivered on both
sides for security. The Wolves proposed that
the Sheep should give up their dogs, on the one
side, and that they would deliver up their young
ones, on the other. This proposal was agreed to;
but no sooner executed, than the young Wolves
began to howl for want of their dams. The old
ones took this opportunity to cry out, the treaty
was broke; and so falling upon the Sheep, who
were destitute of their faithful guardians the
dogs, they worried and devoured them without
control.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>In all our transactions with mankind, even in
the most private and low life, we should have a
special regard how, and with whom, we trust ourselves.
Men, in this respect, ought to look upon
each other as Wolves, and to keep themselves
under a secure guard, and in a continual posture
of defence. Particularly upon any treaties of
importance, the securities on both sides should be
strictly considered; and each should act with so
cautious a view to their own interest, as never to
pledge or part with that which is the very essence
and basis of their safety and well-being. And if
this be a just and reasonable rule for men to
govern themselves by, in their own private affairs,
how much more fitting and necessary is it in any
conjuncture wherein the public is concerned? If
the enemy should demand our whole army for an
hostage, the danger in our complying with it
would be so gross and apparent, that we could not
help observing it: but, perhaps, a country may
equally expose itself by parting with a particular
town or general, as its whole army; its safety,
not seldom, depending as much upon one of the
former, as upon the latter. In short, hostages
and securities may be something very dear to us,
but ought never to be given up, if our welfare and
preservation have any dependance upon them.</p>

<p>An Eagle that had young ones, looking out for
something to feed them with, happened to spy a
Fox's cub, that lay basking itself abroad in the
sun. She made a stoop, and trussed it immediately;
but before she had carried it quite off,
the old Fox coming home, implored her, with
tears in her eyes, to spare her cub, and pity the
distress of a poor fond mother, who should think
no affliction so great as that of losing her child.
The Eagle, whose nest was up in a very high
tree, thought herself secure enough from all projects
of revenge, and so bore away the cub to her
young ones, without showing any regard to the
supplications of the Fox. But that subtle creature,
highly incensed at this outrageous barbarity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ran to an altar, where some country people had
been sacrificing a kid in the open fields, and
catching up a firebrand in her mouth, made towards
the tree where the Eagle's nest was, with
a resolution of revenge. She had scarce ascended
the first branches, when the Eagle, terrified
with the approaching ruin of herself and family,
begged of the Fox to desist, and, with much
submission, returned her the cub again safe and
sound.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable is a warning to us not to deal hardly
or injuriously by any body. The consideration
of our being in a high condition of life, and those
we hurt, far below us, will plead little or no
excuse for us in this case: for there is scarce a
creature of so despicable a rank, but is capable of
avenging itself some way, and at some time or
other. When great men happen to be wicked,
how little scruple do they make of oppressing
their poor neighbours! They are perched upon a
lofty station, and have built their nest on high;
and, having outgrown all feelings of humanity,
are insensible of any pangs of remorse. The
widow's tears, the orphan's cries, and the curses
of the miserable, like javelins thrown by the hand
of a feeble old man, fall by the way, and never
reach their heart. But let such a one, in the
midst of his flagrant injustice, remember, how
easy a matter it is, notwithstanding his superior
distance, for the meanest vassal to be revenged of
him. The bitterness of an affliction, even where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cunning is wanting, may animate the poorest
spirit with resolutions of vengeance; and, when
once that fury is thoroughly awakened, we know
not what she will require before she is lulled to
rest again. The most powerful tyrants cannot
prevent a resolved assassination; there are a
thousand different ways for any private man to
do the business, who is heartily disposed to it,
and willing to satisfy his appetite for revenge, at
the expense of his life. An old woman may clap
a firebrand in the palace of a prince; and it is
in the power of a poor weak fool to destroy the
children of the mighty.</p>

<p>A Wolf, clothing himself in the skin of a Sheep,
and getting in among the flock, by this means
took the opportunity to devour many of them.
At last the shepherd discovered him, and cunningly
fastening a rope about his neck, tied him
up to a tree which stood hard by. Some other
shepherds happening to pass that way, and observing
what he was about, drew near, and expressed
their amazement at it. 'What,' says one of them,
'brother, do you make hanging of Sheep?'&mdash;'No,'
replies the other; 'but I make hanging of
a Wolf whenever I catch him, though in the habit
and garb of a Sheep.' Then he showed them
their mistake, and they applauded the justice of
the execution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>


<p>APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable shows us, that no regard is to be had
to the mere habit or outside of any person, but to
undisguised worth and intrinsic virtue. When we
place our esteem upon the external garb, before
we inform ourselves of the qualities which it
covers, we may often mistake evil for good, and,
instead of a Sheep, take a Wolf into our protection.
Therefore, however innocent or sanctified
any one may appear, as to the vesture wherewith
he is clothed, we may act rashly, because we
may be imposed upon, if from thence we take it
for granted, that he is inwardly as good and righteous
as his outward robe would persuade us he
is. Men of judgment and penetration do not use
to give an implicit credit to a particular habit, or
a peculiar colour, but love to make a more exact
scrutiny; for he that will not come up to the
character of an honest, good kind of man, when
stripped of his Sheep's Clothing, is but the more
detestable for his intended imposture; as the
Wolf was but the more obnoxious to the shepherd's
resentment, by wearing a habit so little
suiting with his manners.</p>

He clapped the piece to his shoulder, and took

to pull the trigger, an adder, which he had trod
upon under the grass, stung him so painfully in
the leg, that he was forced to quit his design, and
threw his gun down in a passion. The poison
immediately infected his blood, and his whole
body began to mortify; which, when he perceived,
he could not help owning it to be just.
'Fate,' says he, 'has brought destruction upon
me, while I was contriving the death of another.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This is another lesson against injustice; a topic
in which our just Author abounds. And, if we
consider the matter fairly, we must allow it to be
as reasonable that some one should do violence to
us, as we should commit it upon another. When
we are impartial in our reflections, thus we must
always think. The unjust man, with a hardened
unfeeling heart, can do a thousand bitter things
to others: but if a single calamity touches himself,
oh, how tender he is! How insupportable is
the uneasiness it occasions! Why should we think
others born to hard treatment more than ourselves?
Or imagine it can be reasonable to do to
another, what we ourselves should be unwilling
to suffer? In our behaviour to all mankind, we
need only ask ourselves these plain questions, and
our consciences will tell us how to act. Conscience,
like a good valuable domestic, plays the
remembrancer to us upon all occasions, and gives
us a gentle twitch, when we are going to do a
wrong thing. It does not, like the adder in the
fable, bite us to death, but only gives us kind
cautions. However, if we neglect these just and
frequent warnings, and continue in a course of
wickedness and injustice, do not let us be surprised
if Providence thinks fit, at last, to give
us a home sting, and to exercise a little retaliation
upon us.</p>

<p>The being officiously good-natured and civil is

one who is a stranger to us, or though known, is
ill-esteemed by us, will be making offers of services,
we have great reason to look to ourselves,
and exert a shyness and coldness towards him.
We should resolve not to receive even favours

far, before he overtook an Ass, who was labouring
under a heavy burden, and moving slowly on in
the same track with himself. Immediately he
called out to him, in a haughty imperious tone,
and threatened to trample him in the dirt, if he
did not break the way for him. The poor patient
Ass, not daring to dispute the matter, quietly
got out of his way as fast as he could, and let him
go by. Not long after this, the same Horse, in
an engagement with the enemy, happened to be
shot in the eye, which made him unfit for show,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
or any military business; so he was stripped of his
fine ornaments, and sold to a carrier. The Ass,
meeting him in this forlorn condition, thought
that now it was his time to insult; and so, says
he, 'Hey-day, friend, is it you? Well, I always
believed that pride of yours would one day have
a fall.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Pride is a very unaccountable vice: many people
fall into it unawares, and are often led into it by
motives, which, if they considered things rightly,
would make them abhor the very thoughts of it.
There is no man that thinks well of himself, but
desires that the rest of the world should think so
too. Now it is the wrong measures we take in
endeavouring after this, that expose us to discerning
people in that light which they call pride, and
which is so far from giving us any advantage in
their esteem, that it renders us despicable and
ridiculous. It is an affectation of appearing considerable,
that puts men upon being proud and
insolent; and their very being so makes them,
infallibly, little, and inconsiderable. The man
that claims and calls for reverence and respect,
deserves none; he that asks for applause, is sure
to lose it; the certain way to get it is to seem to
shun it; and the humble man, according to the
maxims even of this world, is the most likely to
be exalted. He that, in his words or actions,
pleads for superiority, and rather chooses to do
an ill action, than condescend to do a good one,
acts like the Horse, and is as void of reason and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
understanding. The rich and the powerful want
nothing but the love and esteem of mankind to
complete their felicity; and these they are sure
to obtain by a good-humoured, kind condescension;
and as certain of being every body's aversion,
while the least tincture of overbearing rudeness
is perceptible in their words or actions.
What brutal tempers must they be of, who can
be easy and indifferent, while they know themselves
to be universally hated, though in the
midst of affluence and power! But this is not all;
for if ever the wheel of fortune should whirl
them from the top to the bottom, instead of
friendship or commiseration, they will meet with
nothing but contempt; and that with much
more justice than ever they themselves exerted it
towards others.</p>

life, to be sure! But, supposing it were so, I am
mightily obliged to her, truly, for contriving to
let me be of the male-kind, so that I go every
day in danger of the butcher. What reason then
have I to have a greater regard for one to whom
I am so little indebted for any part of my being,
than for those from whom I have received all the
benevolence and kindness which have hitherto
supported me in life?'</p>

<p>It is they whose goodness makes them our
parents, that properly claim filial respect from us,
and not those who are such only out of necessity.
The duties between parents and their children
are relative and reciprocal. By all laws, natural
as well as civil, it is expected that the parents
should cherish and provide for the child, till it
is able to shift for itself; and that the child, with
a mutual tenderness, should depend upon the
parent for its sustenance, and yield it a reasonable
obedience. Yet, through the depravity of human
nature, we very often see these laws violated,
and the relations before-mentioned treating one
another with as much virulence as enemies of
different countries are capable of. Through the
natural impatience and protervity of youth, we
observe the first occasion for any animosity most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
frequently arising from their side; but, however,
there are not wanting examples of undutiful
parents: and, when a father, by using a son ill,
and denying him such an education and such an
allowance as his circumstances can well afford,
gives him occasion to withdraw his respect from
him, to urge his begetting of him as the sole
obligation to duty, is talking like a silly unthinking
dotard. Mutual benevolence must be kept up
between relations, as well as friends; for, without
this cement, whatever you please to call the
building, it is only a castle in the air, a thing to
be talked of, without the least reality.</p>

<p>A Kite, who had kept sailing in the air for
many days near a dove-house, and made a stoop
at several pigeons, but all to no purpose (for they
were too nimble for him), at last had recourse
to stratagem, and took his opportunity one day
to make a declaration to them, in which he set
forth his own just and good intentions, who had
nothing more at heart than the defence and protection
of the Pigeons in their ancient rights and
liberties, and how concerned he was at their fears
and jealousies of a foreign invasion, especially
their unjust and unreasonable suspicions of himself,
as if he intended, by force of arms, to break
in upon their constitution, and erect a tyrannical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
government over them. To prevent all which,
and thoroughly to quiet their minds, he thought
proper to propose to them such terms of alliance
and articles of peace as might for ever cement a
good understanding between them: the principal
of which was, that they should accept of him for
their king, and invest him with all kingly privilege
and prerogative over them. The poor simple
Pigeons consented: the Kite took the coronation
oath, after a very solemn manner, on his part,
and the Doves, the oaths of allegiance and fidelity,
on theirs. But much time had not passed
over their heads, before the good Kite pretended
that it was part of his prerogative to devour a
Pigeon whenever he pleased. And this he was
not contented to do himself only, but instructed
the rest of the royal family in the same kingly
arts of government. The Pigeons, reduced to
this miserable condition, said one to the other,
'Ah! we deserve no better! Why did we let
him come in!</p>

they were deceived in their expectation; or never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thoroughly knew the manners of their king till
he had got them entirely in his power: which,
however, is notoriously false; for many, with the
Doves in the fable, are so silly, that they would
admit of a Kite, rather than be without a king.

this: an unlimited power should not be trusted

<p>An honest, plain, sensible Country Mouse, is
said to have entertained at his hole one day a
fine Mouse of the Town. Having formerly been
playfellows together, they were old acquaintance,
which served as an apology for the visit. However,
as master of the house, he thought himself
obliged to do the honours of it, in all respects,
and to make as great a stranger of his guest as he
possibly could. In order to this, he set before
him a reserve of delicate grey peas and bacon, a
dish of fine oatmeal, some parings of new cheese,
and, to crown all with a dessert, a remnant of a
charming mellow apple. In good manners, he
forbore to eat any himself, lest the stranger should
not have enough; but, that he might seem to bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the other company, sat and nibbled a piece of a
wheaten straw very busily. At last says the spark
of the town, 'Old crony, give me leave to be a
little free with you; how can you bear to live in
this nasty, dirty, melancholy hole here, with
nothing but woods and meadows, and mountains,
and rivulets, about you? Do not you prefer the
conversation of the world to the chirping of birds,
and the splendour of a court to the rude aspect of
an uncultivated desert! Come, take my word for
it, you will find it a change for the better. Never
stand considering, but away this moment. Remember,
we are not immortal, and therefore have
no time to lose. Make sure of to-day, and spend
it as agreeably as you can; you know not what
may happen to-morrow.' In short, these and
such like arguments prevailed, and his Country
Acquaintance was resolved to go to town that
night. So they both set out upon their journey
together, proposing to sneak in after the close of
the evening. They did so; and, about midnight,
made their entry into a certain great house, where
there had been an extraordinary entertainment
the day before, and several tit-bits, which some
of the servants had purloined, were hid under the
seat of a window. The Country Guest was immediately
placed in the midst of a rich Persian
carpet: and now it was the Courtier's turn to
entertain; who, indeed, acquitted himself in that
capacity with the utmost readiness and address,
changing the courses as elegantly, and tasting
every thing first as judiciously, as any clerk of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
kitchen, the other sat and enjoyed himself like
a delighted epicure, tickled to the last degree
with this new turn of his affairs; when, on a
sudden, a noise of somebody opening the door
made them start from their seats, and scuttle in
confusion about the dining-room. Our Country
Friend, in particular, was ready to die with fear
at the barking of a huge mastiff or two, which
opened their throats just about the same time,
and made the whole house echo. At last, recovering
himself&mdash;'Well,' says he, 'if this be your
town life, much good may do you with it: give
me my poor quiet hole again, with my homely,
but comfortable, grey peas.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>A moderate fortune, with a quiet retirement in
the country, is preferable to the greatest affluence
which is attended with care and the perplexity of
business, and inseparable from the noise and hurry
of the town. The practice of the generality of
people of the best taste, it is to be owned, is
directly against us in this point; but, when it is
considered that this practise of theirs proceeds
rather from a compliance with the fashion of the
times, than their own private thoughts, the
objection is of no force. Among the great
numbers of men who have received a learned
education, how few are there but either have their
fortunes entirely to make, or, at least, think they
deserve to have, and ought not to lose the opportunity
of getting, somewhat more than their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fathers have left them! The town is the field of
action for volunteers of this kind; and whatever
fondness they may have for the country, yet they
must stay till their circumstances will admit of a
retreat thither. But sure there never was a man
yet, who lived in a constant return of trouble and
fatigue in town, as all men of business do in some
degree or other, but has formed to himself some
end of getting some sufficient competency, which
may enable him to purchase a quiet possession in
the country, where he may indulge his genius,
and give up his old age to that easy smooth life
which, in the tempest of business, he had so often
longed for. Can any thing argue more strongly
for a country life, than to observe what a long
course of labour people go through, and what
difficulties they encounter to come at it? They
look upon it, at a distance, like a kind of heaven, a
place of rest and happiness; and are pushing
forward through the rugged thorny cares of the
world, to make their way towards it. If there
are many who, though born to plentiful fortunes,
yet live most part of their time in the noise, the
smoke, and hurry of the town, we shall find,
upon inquiry, that necessary indispensible business
is the real or pretended plea which most of
them have to make for it. The court and the
senate require the attendance of some: lawsuits,
and the proper direction of trade, engage others:
they who have a sprightly wit and an elegant
taste for conversation, will resort to the place
which is frequented by people of the same turn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
whatever aversion they may otherwise have for
it; and others, who have no such pretence, have
yet this to say, that they follow the fashion.
They who appear to have been men of the best
sense amongst the ancients, always recommended
the country as the most proper scene for innocence,
ease, and virtuous pleasure; and, accordingly,
lost no opportunities of enjoying it: and
men of the greatest distinction among the moderns,
have ever thought themselves most happy when
they could be decently spared from the employments
which the excellency of their talents necessarily
threw them into, to embrace the charming
leisure of a country life.</p>

<p>A farmer was sowing his field with flax. The
Swallow observed it, and desired the other Birds
to assist her in picking the seed up, and in
destroying it; telling them, that flax was that
pernicious material of which the thread was composed
which made the fowler's nets, and by that
means contributed to the ruin of so many innocent
birds. But the poor Swallow not having the
good fortune to be regarded, the flax sprung up,
and appeared above the ground. She then put
them in mind once more of their impending
danger, and wished them to pluck it up in the
bud, before it went any further. They still neglected
her warnings; and the flax grew up into
the high stalk. She yet again desired them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
attack it, for that it was not yet too late. But all
that she could get was to be ridiculed and despised
for a silly pretending prophet. The Swallow
finding all her remonstrances availed nothing,
was resolved to leave the society of such unthinking,
careless creatures, before it was too late. So
quitting the woods, she repaired to the houses,
and forsaking the conversation of the Birds, has
ever since made her abode among the dwellings
of men.</p>

<p>As men, we should always exercise so much

<p>It is said that a Beaver (a creature which lives
chiefly in the water) has a certain part about him
which is good in physic, and that, upon this
account, he is often hunted down and killed. Once
upon a time, as one of these creatures was hard
pursued by the dogs, and knew not how to escape,
recollecting with himself the reason of his being
thus persecuted, with a great resolution and presence
of mind, he bit off the part which his hunters
wanted, and throwing it towards them, by these
means escaped with his life.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>However it is among beasts, there are few
human creatures but what are hunted for something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
else besides either their lives or the pleasure
of hunting them. The inquisition would hardly
be so keen against the Jews, if they had not
something belonging to them which their persecutors
esteem more valuable than their souls;
which whenever that wise, but obstinate people,
can prevail with themselves to part with, there is
an end of the chase for that time. Indeed, when
life is pursued, and in danger, whoever values it,
should give up every thing but his honour to
preserve it. And when a discarded minister is
prosecuted for having damaged the commonwealth,
let him but throw down some of the fruits
of his iniquity to the hunters, and one may engage
for his coming off, in other respects, with a whole
skin.</p>

<p>As the Cat and the Fox were talking politics

Reynard said, 'Let things turn out ever so bad,

them yet, before they should hurt him.'&mdash;'But
pray,' says he, 'Mrs. Puss, suppose there should
be an invasion, what course do you design to
take?'&mdash;'Nay,' says the Cat, 'I have but one shift
for it, and if that won't do, I am undone.'&mdash;'I
am sorry for you, replies Reynard, 'with all my
heart, and would gladly furnish you with one or
two of mine, but indeed, neighbour, as times go,
it is not good to trust; we must even be every
one for himself, as the saying is, and so your
humble servant.' These words were scarce out of
his mouth, when they were alarmed with a pack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of hounds, that came upon them full cry. The
Cat, by the help of her single shift, ran up a
tree, and sat securely among the top branches;
from whence she beheld Reynard, who had not
been able to get out of sight, overtaken with his
thousand tricks, and torn in as many pieces by
the dogs which had surrounded him.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>A man that sets up for more cunning than the
rest of his neighbours, is generally a silly fellow
at the bottom. Whoever is master of a little
judgment and insight into things, let him keep
them to himself, and make use of them as he sees
occasion; but he should not be teasing others
with an idle and impertinent ostentation of them.
One good discreet expedient, made use of upon
an emergency, will do a man more real service,
and make others think better of him, than to
have passed all along for a shrewd crafty knave,
and be bubbled at last. When any one has been
such a coxcomb as to insult his acquaintance, by
pretending to more policy and stratagem than
the rest of mankind, they are apt to wish for
some difficulty for him to show his skill in;
where, if he should miscarry (as ten to one but
he does) his misfortune, instead of pity, is sure to
be attended with laughter. He that sets up for a
biter, as the phrase is, being generally intent upon
his prey, or vain of showing his art, frequently
exposes himself to the traps of one sharper than
himself, and incurs the ridicule of those whom he
designed to make ridiculous.</p>

<p>A certain house was much infested with
Mice; but at last they got a Cat, who catched

finding their numbers grow thin, consulted what
was best to be done for the preservation of the
public from the jaws of the devouring Cat.
They debated and came to this resolution, That
no one should go down below the upper shelf.
The Cat, observing the mice no longer came
down as usual, hungry and disappointed of her
prey, had recourse to this stratagem; she hung
by her hinder legs on a peg which stuck in the
wall, and made as if she had been dead, hoping
by this lure to entice the Mice to come down.
She had not been in this posture long, before a

<p>The Lion and several other beasts entered into

having made a sort of an excursion by way of
hunting, they took a very fine, large, fat deer,
which was divided into four parts; there happening
to be then present his majesty the Lion, and
only three others. After the division was made,
and the parts were set out, his majesty advancing
forward some steps, and pointing to one of the
shares, was pleased to declare himself after the
following manner: 'This I seize and take possession
of as my right, which devolves to me, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
am descended by a true, lineal, hereditary succession
from the royal family of Lion: that
(pointing to the second) I claim by, I think, no
unreasonable demand; considering that all the
engagements you have with the enemy turn chiefly
upon my courage and conduct; and you very well
know, that wars are too expensive to be carried
on without proper supplies. Then (nodding his
head towards the third) that I shall take by virtue
of my prerogative; to which, I make no question,
but so dutiful and loyal a people will pay all the
deference and regard that I can desire. Now, as
for the remaining part, the necessity of our present
affairs is so very urgent, our stock so low,
and our credit so impaired and weakened, that I
must insist upon your granting that, without any
hesitation or demur; and hereof fail not at your

pretences to furnish out their declarations

trust itself first in the hands of those that are more
powerful than themselves, or to wonder afterwards

<p>A Lion, faint with heat, and weary with hunting,
was laid down to take his repose under the
spreading boughs of a thick shady oak. It happened
that, while he slept, a company of scrambling
Mice ran over his back, and waked him:
upon which, starting up, he clapped his paw upon
one of them, and was just going to put it to death;
when the little suppliant implored his mercy in a
very moving manner, begging him not to slain his
noble character with the blood of so despicable
and small a beast. The Lion, considering the
matter, thought proper to do as he was desired,
and immediately released his little trembling
prisoner. Not long after, traversing the forest in
pursuit of his prey, he chanced to run into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
toils of the hunters; from whence, not able to
disengage himself, he set up a most hideous and
loud roar. The Mouse, hearing the voice, and
knowing it to be the Lion's, immediately repaired
to the place, and bid him fear nothing, for that
he was his friend. Then straight he fell to work,
and, with his little sharp teeth, gnawing asunder
the knots and fastenings of the toils, set the royal
brute at liberty.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable gives us to understand, that there is
no person in the world so little, but even the
greatest may, at some time or other, stand in need
of his assistance; and consequently that it is good
to use clemency, where there is any room for it,
towards those who fall within our power. A
generosity of this kind is a handsome virtue, and
looks very graceful whenever it is exerted, if there
were nothing else in it: but as the lowest people
in life may, upon occasion, have it in their power
either to serve or hurt us, that makes it our duty,
in point of common interest, to behave ourselves
with good nature and lenity towards all with
whom we have to do. Then the gratitude of the
Mouse, and his readiness not only to repay, but
even to exceed, the obligation due to his benefactor,

desired his little deliverer to name his own

Mouse, fired with ambition at this gracious offer,
did not so much consider what was proper for him
to ask, as what was in the power of his prince to
grant; and so presumptuously demanded his
princely daughter, the young Lioness, in marriage.
The Lion consented: but, when he would
have given the royal virgin into his possession,
she, like a giddy thing as she was, not minding
how she walked, by chance set her paw upon her

of fortune, to make us happy. It is the want or
possession of a good judgment which oftentimes
makes the prince a poor wretch, and the poor
philosopher completely easy. Now, the first and
chief degree of judgment is to know one's self;
to be able to make a tolerable estimate of one's
own capacity, so as not to speak or undertake
any thing which may either injure or make us
ridiculous: and yet (as wonderful as it is) there
have been men of allowed good sense in particular,
and possessed of all desirable qualifications
in general, to make life delightful and agreeable,
who have unhappily contrived to match themselves
with women of a genius and temper necessarily
tending to blast their peace. This proceeds
from some unaccountable blindness: but when
wealthy plebeians, of mean extraction and unrefined
education, as an equivalent for their money,
demand brides out of the nurseries of our peerage,
their being despised, or at least overlooked, is
so unavoidable, unless in extraordinary cases,
that nothing but a false taste of glory could make
them enter upon a scheme so inconsistent and
unpromising.</p>

<p>A certain man had a Dog, which was so fierce
and mischievous, that he was forced to fasten a
heavy clog about his neck, to keep him from running
at and worrying people. This the vain cur
took for a badge of honourable distinction; and
grew so insolent upon it, that he looked down
with an air of scorn upon the neighbouring dogs,
and refused to keep them company. But a sly
old poacher, who was one of the gang, assured
him, that he had no reason to value himself upon
the favour he wore, since it was fixed upon him
rather as a mark of disgrace than of honour.</p>

betray any weaknesses in conversation, which
are apt to excite the laughter of their company,
they make no scruple of ascribing it to their
superiority in point of wit. If want of sense or

them to give, or mistake, affronts, upon
which account all discreet sensible people are
obliged to shun their company, they impute it to
their own valour and magnanimity, to which
they fancy the world pays an awful and respectful
deference. There are several decent ways of
preventing such turbulent men from doing mischief,
which might be applied with secrecy, and

<p>An Ox, grazing in a meadow, chanced to set his
foot among a parcel of young Frogs, and trod
one of them to death. The rest informed their
mother, when she came home, what had happened;
telling her, that the beast which did it
was the hugest creature that they ever saw in
their lives. 'What, was it so big?' says the old
Frog, swelling and blowing up her speckled
belly to a great degree. 'Oh! bigger by a vast
deal,' say they. 'And so big?' says she, straining
herself yet more. 'Indeed, mamma,' say
they, 'If you were to burst yourself, you would
never be so big.' She strove yet again, and
burst herself indeed.</p>

<p>Whenever a man endeavours to live equal with

to share a like fate with the Frog in the fable.
How many vain people, of moderate easy circumstances,
burst and come to nothing, by vying
with those whose estates are more ample than
their own? Sir Changeling Plumstock was possessed
of a very considerable estate, devolved to
him by the death of an old uncle, who had
adopted him his heir. He had a false taste of
happiness, and, without the least economy, trusting
to the sufficiency of his vast revenue, was
resolved to be outdone by nobody in showish
grandeur and expensive living. He gave five
thousand pounds for a piece of ground in the
country to set a house upon; the building and
furniture of which cost fifty thousand more; and
his gardens were proportionably magnificent.
Besides which, he thought himself under a necessity
of buying out two or three tenements which
stood in his neighbourhood, that he might have
elbow-room enough. All this he could very well
bear; and still might have been happy, had it
not been for an unfortunate view which he one
day happened to take of my Lord Castlebuilder's
gardens, which consisted of twenty acres, whereas
his own were not above twelve. From that time
he grew pensive; and, before the ensuing winter,
gave five and thirty years purchase for a dozen
acres more to enlarge his gardens; built a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of exorbitant greenhouses, and a large pavilion
at the further end of a terrace-walk. The bare
repairs and superintendencies of all which call for
the remaining part of his income. He is mortgaged
pretty deep, and pays nobody; but, being
a privileged person, resides altogether at a private
cheap lodging in the City of Westminster.</p>

<p>The first time the Fox saw the Lion, he fell
down at his feet, and was ready to die with fear.
The second time, he took courage, and could even

the impudence to come up to him, to salute him,

<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>From this fable we may observe the two extremes
in which we may fail, as to a proper
behaviour towards our superiors: the one is a
bashfulness, proceeding either from a vicious
guilty mind, or a timorous rusticity; the other,
an over-bearing impudence, which assumes more
than becomes it, and so renders the person insufferable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to the conversation of well-bred reasonable
people. But there is this difference between the
bashfulness that arises from a want of education,
and the shamefacedness that accompanies conscious
guilt; the first, by a continuance of time
and a nearer acquaintance, may be ripened into
a proper liberal behaviour; the other no sooner
finds an easy practicable access, but it throws off
all manner of reverence, grows every day more
and more familiar, and branches out into the
utmost indecency and irregularity. Indeed, there
are many occasions which may happen to cast an
awe, or even a terror, upon our minds at first
view, without any just and reasonable grounds;
but upon a little recollection, or a nearer insight,
we recover ourselves, and can appear indifferent
and unconcerned, where, before, we were ready
to sink under a load of diffidence and fear. We
should, upon such occasions, use our endeavours
to regain a due degree of steadiness and resolution;
but, at the same time, we must have a care
that our efforts in that respect do not force the
balance too much, and make it rise to an unbecoming
freedom and an offensive familiarity.</p>

<p>The Ape meeting the Fox one day, humbly
requested him to give him a piece of his fine, long,
brush tail, to cover his poor naked backside, which
was exposed to all the violence and inclemency
of the weather; 'For,' says he, 'Reynard, you
have already more than you have occasion for,
and a great part of it even drags along in the
dirt.' The Fox answered, 'That as to his having
too much, that was more than he knew; but be
it as it would, he had rather sweep the ground
with his tail, as long as he lived, than deprive
himself of the least bit to cover the Ape's nasty
stinking posteriors.'</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>APPLICATION.</p>

<p>One cannot help considering the world, in the
particular of the goods of fortune, as a kind of
lottery; in which some few are entitled to prizes
of different degrees; others, and those by much
the greatest part, come off with little or nothing.
Some, like the Fox, have even larger circumstances
than they know what to do with, insomuch
that they are rather a charge and incumbrance
than of any true use and pleasure to them.
Others, like the poor Ape's case, are all blank;
not having been so lucky as to draw from the
wheel of fortune wherewith to cover their nakedness,
and live with tolerable decency. That these
things are left, in a great measure, by Providence,
to the blind uncertain shuffle of chance, is reasonable
to conclude from the unequal distribution
of them; for there is seldom any regard had
to true merit upon these occasions; folly and
knavery ride in coaches, while good sense and
honesty walk in the dirt. The all-wise Disposer
of events does certainly permit these things for
just and good purposes, which our shallow understanding
is not able to fathom; but, humanly
thinking, if the riches and power of the world
were to be always in the hands of the virtuous
part of mankind, they would be more likely to do
good with them in their generation, than the vile
sottish wretches who generally enjoy them. A
truly good man would direct all the superfluous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
part of his wealth, at least, for the necessities of
his fellow-creatures, though there were no religion
which enjoined it: but selfish and avaricious
people, who are always great knaves, how much
soever they may have, will never think they have
enough: much less be induced, by any consideration
of virtue and religion, to part with the
least farthing for public charity and beneficence.</p>

<p>A Dog was lying upon a manger full of hay.
An Ox, being hungry, came near, and offered to
eat of the hay; but the envious ill-natured cur,
getting up and snarling at him, would not suffer

<p>Envy is the most unnatural and unaccountable
of all the passions. There is scarce any other
emotion of the mind, however unreasonable, but
may have something said in excuse for it; and
there are many of these weaknesses of the soul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which, notwithstanding the wrongness and irregularity
of them, swell the heart, while they last,
with pleasure and gladness. But the envious man
has no such apology as this to make; the stronger
the passion is, the greater torment he endures;
and subjects himself to a continual real pain, by
only wishing ill to others. Revenge is sweet,
though cruel and inhuman; and though it sometimes
thirsts even for blood, yet may be glutted
and satiated. Avarice is something highly monstrous
and absurd; yet, as it is a desire after
riches, every little acquisition gives it pleasure;
and to behold and feel the hoarded treasure, to a
covetous man, is a constant uncloying enjoyment.
But envy, which is an anxiety arising in our
minds, upon our observing accomplishments in
others which we want ourselves, can never receive
any true comfort, unless in a deluge, a conflagration,
a plague, or some general calamity that
should befal mankind: for, as long as there is a
creature living, that enjoys its being happily
within the envious man's sphere, it will afford
nourishment to his distempered mind; but such
nourishment as will make him pine, and fret,
and emaciate himself to nothing.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there commenced a fierce
war between the Birds and the Beasts; when
the Bat, taking advantage of his ambiguous
make hoped, by that means, to live secure in a
state of neutrality, and save his bacon. It was not
long before the forces on each side met, and gave
battle; and, their animosities running very high,
a bloody slaughter ensued. The Bat, at the
beginning of the day, thinking the birds most
likely to carry it, listed himself among them; but
kept fluttering at a little distance, that he might
the better observe, and take his measures accordingly.
However, after some time spent in the
action, the army of the Beasts seeming to prevail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he went entirely over to them, and endeavoured
to convince them, by the affinity which he had
to a Mouse, that he was by nature a beast, and
would always continue firm and true to their
interest. His plea was admitted; but, in the
end, the advantage turning completely on the
side of the Birds, under the admirable conduct
and courage of their general the Eagle, the
Bat, to save his life, and escape the disgrace of
falling into the hands of his deserted friends,
betook himself to flight; and ever since, skulking
in caves and hollow trees all day, as if ashamed
to show himself, he never appears till the dusk of
the evening, when all the feathered inhabitants

<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>For any one to desert the interest of his country,

men who have been guilty of it, perhaps there
have been as many criminals in the case before

the aggravation and extraordinary degree of

<p>A skilful archer coming into the woods,
directed his arrows so successfully, that he slew
many wild beasts, and pursued several others.
This put the whole savage kind into a fearful
consternation, and made them fly to the most
retired thickets for refuge. At last, the Tiger
resumed a courage, and, bidding them not to be
afraid, said, that he alone would engage the
enemy; telling them, they might depend upon
his valour and strength to revenge their wrongs.
In the midst of these threats, while he was lashing
himself with his tail, and tearing up the ground
for anger, an arrow pierced his ribs, and hung by
its barbed point in his side. He set up an hideous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76]</a></span>
and loud roar, occasioned by the anguish which
he felt, and endeavoured to draw out the painful
dart with his teeth; when the Fox, approaching
him, inquired with an air of surprise, who it was

wound so mighty and valorous a beast?&mdash;'Ah!'

<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Though strength and courage are very good
ingredients towards the making us secure and
formidable in the world, yet, unless there be a
proper portion of wisdom or policy to direct them,
instead of being serviceable, they often prove
detrimental to their proprietors. A rash froward
man, who depends upon the excellence of his own
parts and accomplishments, is likewise apt to
expose a weak side, which his enemies might not
otherwise have observed, and gives an advantage
to others by those very means which he fancied
would have secured it to himself. Counsel and
conduct always did, and always will, govern the
world; and the strong, in spite of all their force,
can never avoid being tools to the crafty. Some
men are as much superior to others in wisdom
and policy, as man, in general, is above a brute.
Strength ill-concerted, opposed to them, is like a
quarter staff in the hands of a huge, robust, but
bungling fellow, who fights against a master of
the science. The latter, though without a weapon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77]</a></span>
would have skill and address enough to disarm
his adversary, and drub him with his own staff.
In a word, savage fierceness and brutal strength
must not pretend to stand in competition with
finesse and stratagem.</p>

upon it, that they think all other creatures beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

you have observed may be true, and that
not without reason. You produce a great many

as it was carried along by the stream, some of its
boughs brushed against a Reed which grew near
the shore. This struck the Oak with a thought
of admiration; and he could not forbear asking
the Reed, how he came to stand so secure and
unhurt, in a tempest which had been furious
enough to tear an Oak up by the roots? 'Why,'
says the Reed, 'I secure myself by putting on a
behaviour quite contrary to what you do; instead
of being stubborn and stiff, and confiding in my

<p>Though a tame submission to injuries which it
is in our power to redress, be generally esteemed
a base and a dishonourable thing; yet, to resist
where there is no probability, or even hopes, of
our getting the better, may also be looked upon
as the effect of a blind temerity, and perhaps of a
weak understanding. The strokes of fortune are
oftentimes as irresistible as they are severe; and
he who, with an impatient reluctant spirit, fights
against her, instead of alleviating, does but double
her blows upon himself. A person of a quiet still
temper, whether it is given him by Nature, or
acquired by art, calmly composes himself, in the
midst of a storm, so as to elude the shock, or
receive it with the least detriment; like a prudent
experienced sailor, who is swimming to the shore
from a wrecked vessel in a swelling sea, he does
not oppose the fury of the waves, but stoops and
gives way, that they may roll over his head
without obstruction. The doctrine of absolute
submission in all cases is an absurd dogmatical
precept, with nothing but ignorance and superstition
to support it: but, upon particular occasions,

submit patiently is one of the most reasonable

<p>A dispute once arose between the north Wind

do, instead of making the man quit his cloak,
obliged him to gird it about his body as close as
possible. Next came the Sun, who, breaking
out from a thick watery cloud, drove away the
cold vapours from the sky, and darted his warm
sultry beams upon the head of the poor weather-beaten
traveller. The man growing faint with

<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>There is something in the temper of men so
averse to severe and boisterous treatment, that
he who endeavours to carry his point that way,
instead of prevailing, generally leaves the mind
of him, whom he has thus attempted, in a more
confirmed and obstinate situation than he found
it at first. Bitter words and hard usage freeze the
heart into a kind of obduracy, which mild persuasion
and gentle language only can dissolve and
soften. Persecution has always fixed and rivetted
those opinions which it was intended to dispel;
and some discerning men have attributed the
quick growth of Christianity, in a great measure,
to the rough and barbarous reception which
its first teachers met with in the world. The
same may have been observed of our reformation;
the blood of the martyrs was the manure which
produced that great Protestant crop, on which
the church of England has subsisted ever since.
Providence, which always makes use of the most
natural means to attain its purpose, has thought
fit to establish the purest religion by this method:
the consideration of which may give a proper
check to those who are continually endeavouring
to root out errors by that very management,
which so infallibly fixes and implants all opinions,
as well erroneous as orthodox. When an opinion
is so violently attacked, it raises an attention in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>

vanity, by making them think that worth defending
and keeping, at the hazard of their lives,
which, perhaps, otherwise they would only have
admired awhile for the sake of its novelty, and
afterwards resigned of their own accord. In
short, a fierce turbulent opposition, like the north
Wind, only serves to make a man wrap up his
notions more closely about him; but we know
not what a kind, warm, Sun-shiny behaviour,
rightly applied, would not be able to effect.</p>

<p>There was once a great emulation between the
Frog and the Mouse, which should be master
of the fen, and wars ensued upon it. But the
crafty Mouse, lurking under the grass in ambuscade,
made sudden sallies, and often surprised
the enemy at a disadvantage. The Frog, excelling
in strength, and being more able to leap
abroad and take the field, challenged the Mouse
to single combat. The Mouse accepts the challenge;
and each of them entered the lists, armed
with a point of a bulrush instead of a spear. A
Kite, sailing in the air, beheld them afar off;
and, while they were eagerly bent upon each
other, and pressing on to the duel, this fatal
enemy descended souse upon them, and with her
crooked talons carried off both the champions.</p>

<p>Nothing so much exposes a man's weak side,
and lays him so open to an enemy, as passion
and malice. He whose attention is wholly fixed
upon forming a project of revenge, is ignorant of
the mischiefs that may be hatching against him
from some other quarter, and, upon the attack, is
unprovided with the means of defending or securing
himself. How are the members of a commonwealth
sometimes divided amongst themselves,
and inspired with rancour and malice to the last
degree; and often upon as great a trifle as that
which was the subject matter of debate between
the Frog and the Mouse; not for any real advantage,
but merely who shall get the better in the
dispute? But such animosities, as insignificant
and trifling as they may be among themselves,
are yet of the last importance to their enemies,
by giving them many fair opportunities of falling
upon them, and reducing them to misery and
slavery. O Britons, when will ye be wise!
when will ye throw away the ridiculous distinctions
of party, those ends of bulrushes, and by a
prudent union secure yourselves in a state of
peace and prosperity! A state, of which, if it were
not for your intolerably foolish and unnecessary
divisions at home, all the powers upon earth could
never deprive you.</p>

<p>The Frogs, living an easy free life every where
among the lakes and ponds, assembled together,
one day, in a very tumultuous manner, and petitioned
Jupiter to let them have a King, who
might inspect their morals, and make them live
a little honester. Jupiter, being at that time in
pretty good humour, was pleased to laugh heartily
at their ridiculous request; and, throwing a little
log down into the pool, cried, 'There is a King
for you.' The sudden splash which this made by
its fall into the water, at first terrified them so
exceedingly, that they were afraid to come near
it. But in a little time, seeing it lay still without
moving, they ventured, by degrees, to approach
it; and at last, finding there was no danger, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
leaped upon it; and, in short, treated it as familiarly
as they pleased. But not contented with
so insipid a King as this was, they sent their
deputies to petition again for another sort of one;
for this they neither did nor could like. Upon
that he sent them a Stork, who, without any
ceremony, fell a devouring and eating them up,
one after another, as fast as he could. Then they
applied themselves privately to Mercury, and
got him to speak to Jupiter in their behalf, that
he would be so good as to bless them again with
another King, or to restore them to their former
state. 'No,' says he, 'since it was their own
choice, let the obstinate wretches suffer the
punishment due to their folly.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>It is pretty extraordinary to find a fable of this
kind finished with so bold and yet polite a turn
by Phædrus: one who attained his freedom by
the favour of Augustus, and wrote it in the
time of Tiberius; who were, successively, tyrannical
usurpers of the Roman government. If
we may take his word for it, Æsop spoke it upon
this occasion. When the commonwealth of
Athens flourished under good wholesome laws of
its own enacting, they relied so much upon the
security of their liberty, that they negligently
suffered it to run out into licentiousness. And
factions happening to be fomented among them
by designing people, much about the same time,
Pisistratus took that opportunity to make himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
master of their citadel and liberties both together.
The Athenians finding themselves in a slate of
slavery, though their tyrant happened to be a
very merciful one, yet could not bear the thoughts
of it; so that Æsop, where there was no remedy,
prescribes to them patience, by the example of
the foregoing fable; and adds, at last, 'Wherefore,
my dear countrymen, be contented with your
present condition, bad as it is, for fear a change
should be worse.'</p>

<p>A Lion and a Bear fell together by the ears
over the carcass of a Fawn which they found in
the forest, their title to him being to be decided
by force of arms. The battle was severe and
tough on both sides, and they held it out, tearing
and worrying one another so long, that, what
with wounds and fatigue, they were so faint and
weary, that they were not able to strike another
stroke. Thus, while they lay upon the ground,
panting and lolling out their tongues, a Fox
chanced to pass by that way, who, perceiving
how the case stood, very impudently stepped in
between them, seized the booty which they had
all this while been contending for, and carried
it off. The two combatants, who lay and beheld
all this, without having strength enough to stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and prevent it, were only wise enough to make
this reflection: 'Behold the fruits of our strife
and contention! that villain, the Fox, bears away
the prize, and we ourselves have deprived each
other of the power to recover it from him.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>When people go to law about an uncertain title,
and have spent their whole estate in the contest,
nothing is more common than for some little
pettifogging attorney to step in and secure it to
himself. The very name of law seems to imply
equity and justice, and that is the bait which has
drawn in many to their ruin. Others are excited
by their passions, and care not if they destroy
themselves, so they do but see their enemy perish
with them. But, if we lay aside prejudice and
folly, and think calmly of the matter, we shall
find, that going to law is not the best way of
deciding differences about property; it being,
generally speaking, much safer to trust to the
arbitration of two or three honest sensible neighbours,
than, at a vast expense of money, time,
and trouble, to run through the tedious, frivolous
forms, with which, by the artifice of greedy
lawyers, a court of judicature is contrived to
be attended. It has been said, that if mankind
would lead moral virtuous lives, there would be
no occasion for divines; if they would but live
temperately and soberly, that they would never
want physicians; both which assertions, though
true in the main, are yet expressed in too great a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
latitude. But one may venture to affirm, that if
men preserved a strict regard to justice and
honesty in their dealings with each other, and,
upon any mistake or misapprehension, were
always ready to refer the matter to disinterested
umpires, of acknowledged judgment and integrity,
they never could have the least occasion
for lawyers. When people have gone to law, it
is rarely to be found but one or both parties was
either stupidly obstinate, or rashly inconsiderate.
For, if the case should happen to be so intricate,
that a man of common sense could not distinguish
who had the best title, how easy would it be to
have the opinion of the best counsel in the land,
and agree to determine it by that? If it should
appear dubious even after that, how much better
would it be to divide the thing in dispute, rather
than go to law, and hazard the losing not only
of the whole, but costs and damages into the
bargain?</p>

least he might be able to get a little of it. But
his strength was not sufficient for this. At last,

them one by one into the Pitcher; and thus,

<p>Many things which cannot be effected by
strength, or by the vulgar way of enterprising,
may yet be brought about by some new and
untried means. A man of sagacity and penetration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
upon encountering a difficulty or two, does
not immediately despair; but, if he cannot succeed
one way, employs his wit and ingenuity
another; and, to avoid or get over an impediment,
makes no scruple of stepping out of the path of
his forefathers. Since our happiness, next to the
regulation of our minds, depends altogether upon
our having and enjoying the conveniences of life,
why should we stand upon ceremony about the
methods of obtaining them, or pay any deference
to antiquity upon that score? If almost every age
had not exerted itself in some new improvements
of its own, we should want a thousand arts, or,
at least, many degrees of perfection in every art,
which at present we are in possession of. The
invention of any thing which is more commodious
for the mind or body than what they had before,
ought to be embraced readily, and the projector
of it distinguished with a suitable encouragement.
Such as the use of the compass, for example,
from which mankind reaps so much benefit and
advantage, and which was not known to former
ages. When we follow the steps of those who
have gone before us in the old beaten track of
life, how do we differ from horses in a team,
which are linked to each other by a chain or
harness, and move on in a dull heavy pace, to the
tune of their leader's bells? But the man who
enriches the present fund of knowledge with some
new and useful improvement, like a happy adventurer
at sea, discovers, as it were, an unknown
land, and imports an additional trade into his
own country.</p>

before we enter into any degree of friendship,
alliance, or partnership, with any person whatever,
we should thoroughly consider his nature
and qualities, his circumstances and his humour.
There ought to be something in each of these
respects to tally and correspond with our own
measures, to suit our genius, and adapt itself to
the size and proportion of our desires; otherwise
our associations, of whatever kind, may
prove the greatest plagues of our life. Young
men are very apt to run into this error; and
being warm in all their passions, throw open their
arms at once, and admit into the greatest intimacy
persons whom they know little of, but by false
and uncertain lights. Thus they sometimes receive
a Viper into their bosom instead of a friend, and
take a Porcupine for a consort, with whom they
are obliged to cohabit, though she may prove a
thorn in their sides as long as they live. A true
friend is one of the greatest blessings in life;
therefore to be mistaken or disappointed of such
enjoyment, when we hope to be in full possession
of it must be as great a mortification. So that
we cannot be too nice and scrupulous in our
choice of those who are to be our companions for
life: for they must have but a poor shallow notion

for a term of years only. In a word, the doctrine

the person with whom we would jointly manage
and concert measures for the advancement of
our temporal interest, should be narrowly and

the shore after we have launched out of our

terribly frighted, that they ran like mad all over

more security, or to end their unhappy days by
doing violence to themselves. With this resolution
they found an outlet where a pale had been
broken down, and, bolting forth upon an adjoining
common, had not run far before their course
was stopped by that of a gentle brook which
glided across the way they intended to take. This
was so grievous a disappointment, that they were
not able to bear it; and they determined rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to throw themselves headlong into the water, let
what would become of it, than lead a life so full
of dangers and crosses. But, upon their coming
to the brink of the river, a parcel of Frogs, which
were sitting there, frighted at their approach,
leaped into the stream in great confusion, and
dived to the very bottom for fear: which a cunning
old Puss observing, called to the rest and
said, 'Hold, have a care what ye do: here are
other creatures, I perceive, which have their fears
as well as us: don't then let us fancy ourselves
the most miserable of any upon earth; but rather,
by their example, learn to bear patiently those
inconveniences which our nature has thrown
upon us.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable is designed to show us how unreasonable
many people are for living in such continual
fears and disquiets about the miserableness
of their condition. There is hardly any state of
life great enough to satisfy the wishes of an ambitious
man; and scarce any so mean but may
supply all the necessities of him that is moderate.
But if people will be so unwise as to work themselves
up to imaginary misfortunes, why do they
grumble at nature and their stars, when their
own perverse minds are only to blame? If we
are to conclude ourselves unhappy by as many
degrees as there are others greater than we, why
then the greatest part of mankind must be miserable,
in some degree at least. But, if they who
repine at their own afflicted condition, would but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
reckon up how many more there are with whom
they would not change cases, than whose pleasures
they envy, they would certainly rise up better
satisfied from such a calculation. But what shall
we say to those who have a way of creating themselves
panics from the rustling of the wind, the
scratching of a Rat or Mouse behind the hangings,
the fluttering of a Moth, or the motion of
their own shadow by moonlight? Their whole
life is as full of alarms as that of a Hare, and they
never think themselves so happy as when, like
the timorous folks in the fable, they meet with a
set of creatures as fearful as themselves.</p>

Wolf excused himself from seeing him, by pretending
he was very much indisposed. All this
did but confirm the Fox in his suspicions: so
away he goes to a shepherd, and made discovery
of the Wolf; telling him, he had nothing else to
do but to come with a good weapon and knock
him on the head as he lay in his cave. The shepherd
followed his directions, and killed the Wolf.
The wicked Fox enjoyed the cave and provisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to himself, but enjoyed them not long; for the

hole, and seeing the Fox there, dispatched him
also.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable seems to be directed against the
odious trade of informing. Not that giving information
against criminals and enemies of the
public is in itself odious, for it is commendable;
but the circumstances and manner of doing it
oftentimes make it a vile and detestable employment.
He that accuses another merely for the
sake of the promised reward, or in hopes of getting
his forfeited estate, or with any other such
mercenary view, nay, even to save his own life,
whatever he gets by the bargain, is sure to lose
his reputation: for, indeed, the most innocent
company is not safe with such a one in it, nor the
neighbourhood secure in which he lives. A villain
of his stamp, whose only end is getting, will
as soon betray the innocent as the guilty: let
him but know where there is a suspected person,
and propose the reward, and he will scarce fail
to work the suspicion up to high-treason, or be
at a loss to give sufficient proofs of it. We have
no small comfort concerning this sort of people,
when we consider how improbable it is that they
should thrive or prosper long in their ill-gotten
possessions. For he that can betray another for

bad principles, that it cannot be for the interest
of any community to suffer him to live long in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
it. Besides, he himself will not be contented

it then that they look stupidly on, and tamely

Among beasts, who are incapable of being civilized
by social laws, it is no strange thing to
see innocent helpless Sheep fall a prey to Dogs,
Wolves, and Kites: but it is amazing how mankind

of base cowardice, as to suffer some of the worst
of their species to usurp a power over them, to
supersede the righteous laws of good government,

upon his wanting a property which we possess;
for he may, for any thing we know, have as just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
reason to triumph over us, by being master of
some good quality of which we are incapable.
But, in regard to the fable before us, that which
the Peacock values himself upon, the glitter and
finery of dress, is one of the most trifling considerations
in nature; and what a man of sense
would be ashamed to reckon even as the least
part of merit. Indeed, children, and those people
who think much about the same pitch with them,
are apt to be taken with varnish and tinsel: but
they who examine by the scale of common sense
must find something of weight and substance,
before they can be persuaded to set a value. The
mind which is stored with virtuous and rational
sentiments, and the behaviour which speaks complacence
and humility, stamps an estimate upon
the possessor, which all judicious spectators are
ready to admire and acknowledge. But if there
be any merit in an embroidered coat, a brocade
waistcoat, a shoe, a stocking, or a sword-knot,
the person who wears them has the least claim to
it; let it be ascribed where it justly belongs&mdash;to
the several artizans who wrought and disposed
the materials of which they consist. This moral
is not intended to derogate any thing from the
magnificence of fine clothes and rich equipages,
which, as times and circumstances require, may
be used with decency and propriety enough: but
one cannot help being concerned, lest any worth
should be affixed to them more than their own
intrinsic value.</p>

fell to gnawing it as greedily as could be. The

<p>By this fable we are cautioned to consider what
any person is, before we make an attack upon
him after any manner whatsoever: particularly
how we let our tongues slip in censuring the
actions of those who are, in the opinion of the
world, not only of an unquestioned reputation, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

would ruin our credit to all intents and purposes.
If wit be the case, and we have a satirical vein,
which at certain periods must have a flow, let us
be cautious at whom we level it; for if the person's
understanding be of better proof than our
own, all our ingenious sallies, like liquor squirted
against the wind, will recoil back upon our own

<p>An Ass and a Cock happened to be feeding
together in the same place, when on a sudden
they spied a Lion approaching them. This beast
is reported, above all things, to have an aversion,
or rather antipathy, to the crowing of a Cock;
so that he no sooner heard the voice of that bird,
but he betook him to his heels, and run away as
fast as ever he could. The Ass fancying he fled
for fear of him, in the bravery of his heart, pursued
him, and followed him so far, that they were
quite out of the hearing of the Cock; which the
Lion no sooner perceived, but he turned about
and seized the Ass; and just as he was ready to
tear him to pieces, the sluggish creature is said to
have expressed himself thus:&mdash;'Alas! fool that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>

thus, by an affected courage, to throw myself into

<p>There are many who, out of an ambition to
appear considerable, affect to show themselves
men of fire, spirit, and courage: but these being
qualities, of which they are not the right owners,
they generally expose themselves, and show the
little title they have to them, by endeavouring to
exert and produce them at unseasonable times,
or with improper persons. A bully, for fear you
should find him out to be a coward, overacts his
part, and calls you to account for affronts which
a man of true bravery would never have thought
of: and a cowardly silly fellow, observing that
he may take some liberties with impunity, where
perhaps the place or the company protect him,
falsely concludes from thence, that the person
with whom he made free is a greater coward than
himself; so that he not only continues his offensive
raillery and impertinence for the present,
but probably renews them in some place not so
privileged as the former, where his insolence
meets with a due chastisement; than which
nothing is more equitable in itself, or agreeable

<p>A certain Jackdaw was so proud and ambitious,
that, not contented to live within his own
sphere, he picked up the feathers which fell from
the Peacocks, stuck them in among his own,
and very confidently introduced himself into an
assembly of those beautiful birds. They soon
found him out, stripped him of his borrowed
plumes, and, falling upon him with their sharp
bills, punished him as his presumption deserved.
Upon this, full of grief and affliction, he returned
to his old companions, and would have flocked
with them again; but they, knowing his late life
and conversation, industriously avoided him, and
refused to admit him into their company: and
of them, at the same time, gave him this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
serious reproof&mdash;'If, friend, you could have been

barely pleased with appearing above what a man
really is, is bad enough; and what may justly

<p>One day there happened some words between
the Ant and the Fly about precedency, and the

on both sides. Says the Fly, 'It is well known
what my pretensions are, and how justly they are
grounded: there is never a sacrifice that is offered
but I always taste of the entrails, even before the
gods themselves. I have one of the uppermost
seats at church, and frequent the altar as often as
any body: I have a free admission at court; and
can never want the king's ear, for I sometimes sit
upon his shoulder. There is not a maid of honour,

and then I eat and drink the best of every thing,

living. What is there that such country pusses
as you enjoy, to be compared with a life like
this?'&mdash;The Ant, who by this time had composed
herself, replied with a great deal of temper, and
no less severity&mdash;'Indeed, to be a guest at an
entertainment of the gods, is a very great honour,
if one is invited; but I should not care to be a
disagreeable intruder any where. You talk of the
king and the court, and the fine ladies there,
with great familiarity; but, as I have been getting
in my harvest in summer, I have seen a certain
person under the town walls, making a hearty
meal upon something that is not so proper to be
mentioned. As to your frequenting the altars,
you are in the right to take sanctuary where you
are like to meet with the least disturbance: but
I have known people before now run to altars,
and call it devotion, when they have been shut
out of all good company, and had no where else
to go. You do not work for your living, you say,&mdash;true:
therefore, when you have played away
the summer, and winter comes, you have nothing
to live upon; and, while you are starving with
cold and hunger, I have a good warm house over
my head, and plenty of provisions about me.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable points out to us the different characters
of those that recommend themselves in a
vain-glorious way by false and borrowed lights;
and of those whose real merit procures them a
good esteem wherever they go. Poverty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
folly having, at the same time, possession of any
one man, cannot fail of making him an object of
pity, if not of contempt; but, when an empty
conceited pride happens to be joined with them,
they render the creature in whom they meet at
the same time despicable and ridiculous. One
who often attends at court, not because he has a
place, but because he has not, should not value
himself upon his condition. They who go to
church out of vanity and curiosity, and not for
pure devotion, should not value themselves upon
their religion, for it is not worth a straw. They
who eat at a threepenny ordinary, and sometimes
not so well, should not boast either of their dinner
or company. In short, nobody is a better gentleman,
than he whose own honest industry supplies
him with a plenty of all necessaries; who is
so well acquainted with honour, as never to say
or do a mean and unjust thing; and who despises
an idle scoundrel, but knows how to esteem men
of his own principles. Such a one is a person of
the first quality, though he has never a title, and
ought to take place of every man who is not so
good as himself.</p>

<p>In the winter season, a commonwealth of Ants
was busily employed in the management and
preservation of their corn; which they exposed
to the air in heaps round about the avenues of
their little country habitation. A Grasshopper,
who had chanced to outlive the summer, and was
ready to starve with cold and hunger, approached
them with great humility, and begged that they
would relieve his necessity, with one grain of
wheat or rye. One of the Ants asked him, how
he had disposed of his time in summer, that he
had not taken pains, and laid in a stock, as they
had done?&mdash;'Alas, gentlemen,' says he, 'I passed
away the time merrily and pleasantly, in drinking,
singing, and dancing, and never once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
thought of winter.'&mdash;'If that be the case,' replied
the Ant, laughing, 'all I have to say is, that they
who drink, sing, and dance in the summer, must
starve in winter.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>As summer is the season of the year in which
the industrious and laborious husbandman gathers
and lays up such fruits as may supply his necessities
in winter, so youth and manhood are the
times of life which we should employ and bestow
in laying in such a stock of all kind of necessaries
as may suffice for the craving demands of helpless
old age. Yet, notwithstanding the truth of this,
there are many of those which we call rational
creatures, who live in a method quite opposite to
it, and make it their business to squander away,
in a profuse prodigality, whatever they get in
their younger days: as if the infirmity of age
would require no supplies to support it; or, at
least, would find them administered to in some
miraculous way. From this fable we learn this
admirable lesson, never to lose any present
opportunity of providing against the future evils
and accidents of life. While health and the
flower and vigour of our age remain firm and
entire, let us lay them out to the best advantage,
that, when the latter days take hold of us, and
spoil us of our strength and abilities, we may
have a store moderately sufficient to subsist upon,
which we laid up in the morning of our age.</p>

<p>A villager, in a frosty, snowy winter, found
a snake under a hedge, almost dead with cold.
He could not help having compassion for the
poor creature, so brought it home, and laid it
upon the hearth near the fire; but it had not lain
there long, before (being revived with the heat)
it began to erect itself, and fly at his wife and
children, filling the whole cottage with dreadful
hissings. The Countryman hearing an outcry,
and perceiving what the matter was, catched up
a mattock, and soon dispatched him; upbraiding
him at the same time in these words&mdash;'Is this,
vile wretch, the reward you make to him that
saved your life? Die, as you deserve; but a single
death is too good for you.'</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>APPLICATION.</p>

<p>It is the nature of ingrates to return evil for
good: and the moralists, in all ages, have incessantly
declaimed against the enormity of this
crime, concluding, that they who are capable of
hurting their benefactors, are not fit to live in a
community; being such, as the natural ties of
parent, friend, or country, are too weak to restrain
within the bounds of society. Indeed, the sin of
ingratitude is so detestable, that as none but the
most inhuman temper can be guilty of it, so, in
writing to men, there is no occasion to use many
words, either in exposing the vice itself, or dissuading
people from the commission of it. Therefore
it is not likely that a person of Æsop's
sagacity would have compiled this fable, without
having something else in view besides this trite
and obvious subject. He certainly intended to
put us in mind that, as none but a poor silly
clown would go to take up a Snake and cherish
it, so we shall be very negligent and ill-advised
if, in doing good offices, we do not take care to
bestow our benevolence upon proper objects. It
was not at all unnatural in the Snake to hiss,
and brandish his tongue, and fly at the first that
came near him; as soon at the person that saved
his life as any other; indeed, more likely, because
nobody else had so much to do with him.
Nor is it strange at any time to see a reprobate
fool throwing his poisonous language about, and
committing his extravagancies against those,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
more especially, who are so inadvertent as to
concern themselves with him. The Snake and
the reprobate will not appear extraordinary in
their malevolence: but the sensible part of mankind
cannot help thinking those guilty of great
indiscretion, who receive either of them into
their protection.</p>

<p>It was reported that the Lion was sick, and the
beasts were made to believe that they could not
make their court better than by going to visit
him. Upon this they generally went; but it was
particularly taken notice of, that the Fox was
not one of the number. The Lion therefore dispatched
one of his Jackals to sound him about
it, and ask him why he had so little charity and
respect, as never to come near him, at a time
when he lay so dangerously ill, and every body
else had been to see him?&mdash;'Why,' replies the
Fox, 'pray present my duty to his majesty, and
tell him, that I have the same respect for him as
ever, and have been coming several times to kiss
his royal hand: but I am so terribly frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
at the mouth of his cave, to see the print of my
fellow-subjects feet all pointing forwards and
none backwards, that I have not resolution
enough to venture in.' Now the truth of the
matter was, that this sickness of the Lion's was
only a sham to draw the beasts into his den, the
more easily to devour them.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>A man should weigh and consider the nature
of any proposal well before he gives into it; for
a rash and hasty compliance has been the ruin of
many a one. And it is the quintessence of prudence
not to be too easy of belief. Indeed the
multitude think altogether in the same track, and
are much upon a footing. Their meditations are
confined in one channel, and they follow one
another, very orderly, in a regular stupidity. Can
a man of thought and spirit be harnessed thus,
and trudge along like a pack-horse, in a deep,
stinking, muddy road, when he may frisk it over
the beauteous lawns, or lose himself agreeably in
the shady verdant mazes of unrestrained contemplation?
It is impossible. Vulgar notions are so
generally attended with error, that wherever one
traces the footsteps of the many, tending all one
way, it is enough to make one suspect, with the
Fox in the fable, that there is some trick in it.
The eye of reason is dulled and stupified when it
is confined, and made to gaze continually upon
the same thing: it rather chooses to look about
it, and amuse itself with variety of objects, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
they lie scattered up and down in the unbounded
prospect. He that goes implicitly into a thing,
may be mistaken, notwithstanding the number of
those who keep him company; but he that keeps
out till he sees reason to enter, acts upon true
maxims of policy and prudence. In short, it
becomes us, as we are reasonable creatures, to
behave ourselves as such, and to do as few things
as possible, of which we may have occasion to
repent.</p>

<p>A Calf, full of play and wantonness, seeing the
Ox at plough, could not forbear insulting him.
'What a sorry poor drudge art thou,' says he,
'to bear that heavy yoke upon your neck, and
go all day drawing a plough at your tail, to turn
up the ground for your master! but you are a
wretched dull slave, and know no better, or else
you would not do it. See what a happy life I
lead: I go just where I please; sometimes I lie
down under the cool shade; sometimes frisk
about in the open sunshine; and, when I please,
slake my thirst in the clear sweet brook; but
you, if you were to perish, have not so much as a
little dirty water to refresh you.' The Ox, not at
all moved with what he said, went quietly and
calmly on with his work; and, in the evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
was unyoked and turned loose. Soon after which
he saw the Calf taken out of the field, and delivered
into the hands of a priest, who immediately
led him to the altar, and prepared to sacrifice
him. His head was hung round with fillets of
flowers, and the fatal knife was just going to be
applied to his throat, when the Ox drew near, and
whispered him to this purpose&mdash;'Behold the end
of your insolence and arrogance; it was for this
only you were suffered to live at all; and pray
now, friend, whose condition is best, yours or
mine?'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>To insult people in distress is the property of
a cruel, indiscreet, and giddy temper; for, as the
proceedings of fortune are very irregular and
uncertain, we may, the next turn of the wheel, be
thrown down to their condition, and they exalted
to ours. We are likewise given to understand by
this fable what the consequence of an idle life
generally is, and how well satisfied laborious
diligent men are, in the end, when they come
quietly to enjoy the fruits of their industry.
They who by little tricks and sharpings, or by
open violence and robbery, live in a high expensive
way, often in their hearts, at least, despise
the poor honest man who is contented with the
virtuous product of his daily labour, and patiently
submits to his destiny. But how often is the
poor man comforted, by seeing these wanton
villains led in triumph to the altar of justice,
while he has many a cheerful summer's morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to enjoy abroad, and many a long winter's evening
to indulge himself in at home, by a quiet
hearth, and under an unenvied roof: blessings
which often attend a sober industrious man,
though the idle and the profligate are utter
strangers to them. Luxury and intemperance,
besides their being certain to shorten a man's
days, are very apt not only to engage people
with their seeming charms into a debauched life,
utterly prejudicial to their health, but to make
them have a contempt for others, whose good
sense and true taste of happiness inspire them
with an aversion to idleness and effiminacy, and
put them upon hardening their constitution by
innocent exercise and laudable employment.
How many do gluttony and sloth tumble into an
untimely grave! while the temperate and the
active drink sober draughts of life, and spin out
their thread to the most desirable length.</p>

heaven with their prayers; for it is so

be better pleased with virtuous actions and an
honest industry than idle prayers, that it is a sort
of blasphemy to say otherwise. These were the
sentiments of honest good heathens, who were

strange that they should embrace and propagate
such a notion, since it is no other than the dictate
of common reason. What is both strange in

should be enlightened by revelation, are very apt
to be guilty of this stupidity, and, by praying
often for the comforts of life, to neglect that
business which is the proper means of procuring
them. How such a mistaken devotion came to

great sin for a man to fail in his trade or occupation

demonstration in itself, though the Scripture had
never said it, that we please God most when we
are doing the most good: and how can we do
more good than, by a sober honest industry, 'to
provide for those of our own household,' and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
endeavour 'to have to give to him that needeth?'
The man who is virtuously and honestly engaged,
is actually serving God all the while, and is more
likely to have his silent wishes, accompanied
with strenuous endeavours, complied with by the
Supreme Being, than he who begs with a fruitless
vehemence, and solicits with an empty hand: a
hand which would be more religious were it usefully
employed, and more devout were it stretched
forth to do good to those that want it.</p>

<p>In former days, when the Belly and the other
parts of the body enjoyed the faculty of speech,
and had separate views and designs of their own,
each part, it seems, in particular for himself, and
in the name of the whole, took exception at the
conduct of the Belly, and were resolved to
grant him supplies no longer. They said they
thought it very hard that he should lead an idle
good-for-nothing life, spending and squandering
away, upon his own ungodly guts, all the fruits of
their labour; and that, in short, they were resolved
for the future, to strike off his allowance,
and let him shift for himself as well as he could.
The Hands protested they would not lift up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
finger to keep him from starving; and the Mouth
wished he might never speak again if he took in
the least bit of nourishment for him as long as he
lived; and, say the Teeth, may we be rotten if
ever we chew a morsel for him for the future.
This solemn league and covenant was kept as
long as any thing of that kind can be kept, which
was until each of the rebel members pined away
to the skin and bone, and could hold out no
longer. Then they found there was no doing
without the Belly, and that, as idle and insignificant
as he seemed, he contributed as much to
the maintenance and welfare of all the other parts
as they did to his.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable was spoken by Menenius Agrippa,
a famous Roman consul and general, when he
was deputed by the senate to appease a dangerous
tumult and insurrection of the people. The many
wars that nation was engaged in, and the frequent
supplies they were obliged to raise, had so soured
and inflamed the minds of the populace, that
they were resolved to endure it no longer, and
obstinately refused to pay the taxes which were
levied upon them. It is easy to discern how the
great man applied this fable. For, if the branches
and members of a community refuse the government
that aid which its necessities require, the
whole must perish together. The rulers of a state,
as idle and insignificant as they may sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
seem, are yet as necessary to be kept up and
maintained in a proper and decent grandeur, as
the family of each private person is in a condition
suitable to itself. Every man's enjoyment
of that little which he gains by his daily labour,
depends upon the government's being maintained
in a condition to defend and secure him in it.</p>

<p>A Lion seeing a fine plump Nag, had a great
mind to eat a bit of him, but knew not which
way to get him into his power. At last he bethought
himself of this contrivance: he gave out
that he was a physician, who, having gained
experience by his travels into foreign countries,
had made himself capable of curing any sort of
malady or distemper incident to any kind of
beast, hoping by this stratagem to get an easier
admittance among cattle, and find an opportunity
to execute his design. The Horse, who smoked
the matter, was resolved to be even with him;
and, so humouring the thing, as if he suspected
nothing, he prayed the Lion to give him his
advice in relation to a thorn he had got in his
foot, which had quite lamed him, and gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
great pain and uneasiness. The Lion readily
agreed and desired he might see the foot. Upon
which the Horse lifted up one of his hind legs,
and, while the Lion pretended to be poring
earnestly upon his hoof, gave him such a kick
in the face as quite stunned him, and left him
sprawling upon the ground. In the mean time
the Horse trotted away, neighing and laughing
merrily at the success of the trick, by which he
had defeated the purpose of one who intended to
have tricked him out of his life.</p>

<p>Though all manner of fraud and tricking is

disappoint the deceiver, and to repel craft by

and worthy of punishment in its nature, that it
deserves to meet with a return of its own kind:
an open revenge would be too liberal for it, and
nothing matches it but itself. However, therefore,
abominable it is to be the aggressor in this

counterplot and to take all manner of advantage
against the man who is undermining us.</p>

<p>When a wicked man in power has a mind to
glut his appetite in any respect, innocence, or

cries of justice and the voice of reason are of no
effect upon a conscience hardened in iniquity,
and a mind versed in a long practice of wrong
and robbery. Remonstrances, however reasonably
urged, or movingly couched, have no more
influence upon the heart of such a one, than the
gentle evening breeze has upon the oak when it
whispers among its branches, or the rising surges
upon the deaf rock when they dash and break
against its sides. Power should never be trusted

<p>The Leopard one day took it into his head to
value himself upon the great variety and beauty

the Lion should take place of him, since he could
not show so beautiful a skin. As for the rest of
the wild beasts of the forest, he treated them all,
without distinction, in the most haughty disdainful
manner. But the Fox being among them, went
up to him with a great deal of spirit and resolution,
and told him, that he was mistaken in the
value he was pleased to set upon himself; since
people of judgment were not used to form their
opinion of merit from an outside appearance, but
by considering the good qualities and endowments
with which the mind was stored within.</p>

<p>How much more heavenly and powerful would
beauty prove, if it were not so frequently impaired
by the affectation and conceitedness of its possessor!
If some women were but as modest and
unassuming as they are handsome, they might
command the hearts of all that behold them: but
Nature seemed to foresee, and has provided
against such an inconvenience, by tempering its
great master-pieces with a due proportion of
pride and vanity; so that their power, depending
upon the duration of their beauty only, is like to
be but of a short continuance; which, when they
happen to prove tyrants, is no small comfort to
us; and then, even while it lasts, will abate much
of its severity by the allay of those two prevailing
ingredients. Wise men are chiefly captivated
with the charms of the mind; and whenever they
are infatuated with a passion for any thing else,
it is generally observed that they cease, during
that time at least, to be what they were, and are
indeed looked upon to be only playing the fool.
If the fair ones we have been speaking of have a

all the arrows fell out, and mingled with those of
Death, which lay scattered up and down the
place. When he awoke, he gathered them up as
well as he could; but they were so intermingled
that, though he knew the certain number, he
could not rightly distinguish them; from which
it happened that he took up some of the arrows
which belonged to Death, and left several of his
own in the room of them. This is the cause that
we, now and then, see the hearts of the old and

darts of Death.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>If we allow for this fable's being written by a
heathen, and according to the scheme of the
ancient pagan theology, it will appear to be a
pretty probable solution of some parts of the
dispensation of Providence, which otherwise
seem to be obscure and unaccountable. For,
when we see the young and the old fall promiscuously
by the hand of Death, and at the same
time consider that the world is governed by an
all-wise Providence, we are puzzled how to
account for so seemingly preposterous and unnatural
a way of working. We should look upon
a gardener to be mad, or at least very capricious,
who, when his young trees are just arrived to a
degree of bearing, should cut them down for fuel,
and choose out old, rotten, decayed, sapless
stocks to graft and inoculate upon: yet the irregular
proceedings of those two levellers, Love
and Death, appear to be every jot as odd and
unreasonable. However, we must take it for
granted that these things, though the method of
them is hidden from our eyes, are transacted
after the most just and fit manner imaginable:
but, humanly speaking, it is strange that Death
should be suffered to make such undistinguished
havoc in the world; and, at the same time, just
as shocking and unnatural to see old age laid
betwixt a pair of wedding sheets, as it is for
youth and beauty to be locked up in the cold
embraces of the grave.</p>

<p>An Old Man had many Sons, who were often
falling out with one another. When the Father
had exerted his authority, and used other means
in order to reconcile them, and all to no purpose,
at last he had recourse to this expedient: he
ordered his Sons to be called before him, and a
short bundle of sticks to be brought; and then
commanded them, one by one, to try if, with all
their might and strength, they could any of them
break it. They all tried, but to no purpose; for
the sticks being closely and compactly bound up
together, it was impossible for the force of man
to do it. After this the Father ordered the
bundle to be untied, and gave a single stick to
each of his Sons; at the same time bidding him
try to break it: which, when each did with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
imaginable ease, the Father addressed himself
to them to this effect&mdash;'O my Sons, behold the
power of unity! For if you, in like manner, would
but keep yourselves strictly conjoined in the bonds
of friendship, it would not be in the power of any
mortal to hurt you; but when once the ties of
brotherly affection are dissolved, how soon do
you fall to pieces, and are liable to be violated by
every injurious hand that assaults you!'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Nothing is more necessary towards completing
and continuing the well-being of mankind, than
their entering into and preserving friendships and
alliances. The safety of a government depends
chiefly upon this; and therefore it is weakened
and exposed to its enemies, in proportion as it is
divided by parties. "A kingdom divided against
itself, is brought to desolation:" and the same
holds good among all societies and corporations
of men, from the constitution of the nation down
to every little parochial vestry. But the necessity
of friendship extends itself to all sorts of relations
in life, as it conduces mightily to the advantage
of particular clans and families. Those of the
same blood and lineage have a natural disposition
to unite together, which they ought by all means
to cultivate and improve. It must be a great
comfort to people, when they fall under any
calamity, to know there are many others who
sympathize with them; a great load of grief is
mightily lessened, when it is parcelled out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
many shares. And then joy, of all our passions,
loves to be communicative, and generally increases
in proportion to the number of those who
partake of it with us. We defy the threats and
malice of an enemy, when we are assured that
he cannot attack us single, but must encounter a
bundle of allies at the same time. But they that
behave themselves so as to have few or no friends
in the world, live in perpetual fear and jealousy
of mankind, because they are sensible of their
own weakness, and know themselves liable to
be crushed, or broken to pieces, by the first
aggressor.</p>

itself under an affected fierceness; as they who
would smother an ill smell by a cloud of perfume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
are imagined to be but the more offensive. When
we have done all, Nature will remain what she
was, and show herself whenever she is called
upon; therefore whatever we do in contradiction
to her laws, is so forced and affected, that it must
needs expose and make us ridiculous. We talk
nonsense when we would argue against it: like
Teague, who being asked why he fled from his
colours, said, his heart was as good as any in the
regiment; but protested his cowardly legs would
run away with him whatever he could do.</p>

<p>An Old Hound, who had been an excellent
good one in his time, and given his master great
sport and satisfaction in many a chase, at last, by
the effect of years, became feeble and unserviceable.
However, being in the field one day, when
the stag was almost run down, he happened to be
the first that came in with him, and seized him
by one of his haunches; but, his decayed and
broken teeth not being able to keep their hold,
the deer escaped, and threw him quite out.
Upon which his master, being in a great passion,
and going to strike him, the honest old creature
is said to have barked out his apology&mdash;'Ah! do
not strike your poor old servant; it is not my
heart and inclination, but my strength and speed,
that fail me. If what I now am displeases, pray
don't forget what I have been.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable may serve to give us a general view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the ingratitude of the greatest part of mankind.
Notwithstanding all the civility and complaisance
that is used among people where there is a common
intercourse of business, yet let the main
spring, the probability of their being serviceable
to each other, either in point of pleasure or profit,
be but once broken, and farewell courtesy: so
far from continuing any regard in behalf of past
favours, it is very well if they forbear doing any
thing that is injurious. If the master had only
ceased to caress and make much of the Old
Hound, when he was past doing any service, it
had not been very strange; but to treat a poor
creature ill, not for a failure of inclination, but
merely a defect of nature, must, notwithstanding
the crowd of examples there are to countenance
it, be pronounced inhuman and unreasonable.</p>

<p>There are two accounts upon which people that
have been useful are frequently neglected. One,
when they are so decayed, either through age or
some accident, that they are no longer able to do
the services they have formerly done; the other,
when the occasion or emergency which required
such talents no longer exists. Phædrus, who
more than once complains of the bad consequences
of age, makes no other application to
this fable than by telling his friend Philetus,
with some regret, that he wrote it with such a
view; having, it seems, been repaid with neglect,
or worse usage, for services done in his youth to
those who were then able to afford him a better
recompense.</p>

<p>The Camel presented a petition to Jupiter,
complaining of the hardship of his case in not
having, like bulls and other creatures, horns, or
any weapons of defence, to protect himself from
the attacks of his enemies, and praying that relief
might be given him in such manner as might be
thought most expedient. Jupiter could not help
smiling at the impertinent address of the great
silly beast, but, however, rejected the petition;
and told him that, so far from granting his unreasonable
request, henceforward he would take
care his ears should be shortened, as a punishment
for his presumptuous importunity.</p>

that they are very weak superstitious people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
who dream it is to be altered. But, besides the
impossibility of producing a change by addresses
of this nature, they who employ much of their
time upon such accounts, instead of getting, are
sure to lose in the end. When any man is so
frivolous and vexatious as to make unreasonable
complaints, and to harbour undue repinings in
his heart, his peevishness will lessen the real good
which he possesses, and the sourness of his temper
shorten that allowance of comfort which he
already thinks too scanty. Thus, in truth, it is
not Providence, but ourselves who punish our
own importunity in soliciting for impossibilities,
with a sharp corroding care, which abridges us
of some part of that little pleasure which Providence
has cast into our lot.</p>

</div>


<p>A Fox, being caught in a steel trap by his tail,
was glad to compound for his escape with the loss
of it; but, upon coming abroad into the world,
began to be so sensible of the disgrace such a
defect would bring upon him, that he almost
wished he had died rather than left it behind him.
However, to make the best of a bad matter, he
formed a project in his head to call an assembly
of the rest of the Foxes, and propose it for their
imitation, as a fashion which would be very agreeable
and becoming. He did so, and made a long
harangue upon the unprofitableness of tails in
general, and endeavoured chiefly to show the
awkwardness and inconvenience of a Fox's tail
in particular: adding, that it would be both more
graceful and more expeditious to be altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
without them; and that, for his part, what he
had only imagined and conjectured before, he
now found by experience; for that he never
enjoyed himself so well, and found himself so
easy as he had done since he cut off his tail.
He said no more, but looked about with a brisk
air, to see what proselytes he had gained; when
a sly old thief in the company, who understood
trap, answered him with a leer&mdash;'I believe you
may have found a conveniency in parting with
your tail, and when we are in the same circumstances,
perhaps we may do so too.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>If men were but generally as prudent as Foxes,
they would not suffer so many silly fashions to
obtain as are daily brought in vogue, for which
scarce any reason can be assigned besides the
humour of some conceited vain creature; unless,
which is full as bad, they are intended to palliate
some defect in the person that introduces them.
The petticoat of a whole sex has been sometimes
swelled to such a prodigious extent, to screen an
enormity of which only one of them has been
guilty. And it is no wonder that Alexander
the Great could bring a wry-neck into fashion,
in a nation of slaves, when we consider what
power of this nature some little, insignificant,
dapper fellows have had among a free people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>A Crow having taken a piece of cheese out of
a cottage window, flew up into a high tree with
it, in order to eat it; which a Fox observing, came
and sat underneath, and began to compliment
the Crow upon the subject of her beauty. 'I
protest,' says he, 'I never observed it before, but
your feathers are of a more delicate white than
any that ever I saw in my life! Ah; what a fine
shape and graceful turn of body is there! And I
make no question but you have a tolerable voice.
If it is but as fine as your complexion, I do not
know a bird that can pretend to stand in competition
with you.' The Crow, tickled with this
very civil language, nestled and riggled about,
and hardly knew where she was; but thinking
the Fox a little dubious as to the particular of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
her voice, and having a mind to set him right in
that matter, began to sing, and in the same instant
let the cheese drop out of her mouth. This
being what the Fox wanted, he chopped it up
in a moment, and trotted away, laughing to himself
at the easy credulity of the Crow.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>They that love flattery (as it is to be feared too
many do) are in a fair way to repent of their
foible in the long run. And yet how few are
there among the whole race of mankind who may
be said to be full proof against its attacks! The
gross way by which it is managed by some silly
practitioners, is enough to alarm the dullest
apprehension, and make it to value itself upon
the quickness of its insight into the little plots of
this nature: but let the ambuscade be disposed
with due judgment, and it will scarce fail of seizing
the most guarded heart. How many are tickled
to the last degree with the pleasure of flattery,
even while they are applauded for their honest
detestation of it! There is no way to baffle the
force of this engine but by every one's examining,
impartially for himself, the true estimate of his
own qualities: if he deals sincerely in the matter,
nobody can tell so well as himself what degree of
esteem ought to attend any of his actions, and
therefore he should be entirely easy as to the
opinion men are like to have of them in the
world. If they attribute more to him than is his
due, they are either designing or mistaken: if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
they allow him less, they are envious, or, possibly,
still mistaken; and, in either case, are to be despised
or disregarded. For he that flatters, without
designing to take advantage of it, is a fool;
and whoever encourages that flattery which he has
sense enough to see through, is a vain coxcomb.</p>

into a net which a husbandman had planted there

off, and seeing the Hawk fluttering in the net,
came and took him: but, just as he was going to
kill him, the Hawk besought him to let him go,
assuring him that he was only following a Pigeon,
and neither intended nor had done any harm to

whether he is not acting injuriously at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
time that he fancies he is only doing his duty.
Now the best way of being convinced, whether
what we do is reasonable and fit, is to put ourselves
in the place of the persons with whom we
are concerned, and then consult our conscience
about the rectitude of our behaviour. For this
we may be assured of, that we are acting wrong
whenever we are doing any thing to another
which we should think unjust if it was done to
us. Nothing but an habitual inadvertency, as to
this particular, can be the occasion that so many
ingenious noble spirits are often engaged in
courses so opposite to virtue and honour. He
that would startle, if a little attorney should
tamper with him to forswear himself, to bring off
some small offender, some ordinary trespasser,
will, without scruple, infringe the constitution of
his country for the precarious prospect of a place
or a pension. Which is most corrupt, he that
lies, like a knight of the post, for half-a-crown
and a dinner, or he that does it for the more substantial
consideration of a thousand pounds a
year? Which would be doing most service to the
public, giving true testimony in a cause between
two private men, and against one little common
thief who has stolen a gold watch; or voting
honestly and courageously against a rogue of
state, who has gagged and bound the laws, and
stripped the nation? Let those who intend to act
justly, but view things in this light, and all would
be well. There would be no danger of their
oppressing others, or fear of being oppressed
themselves.</p>

the house, in expectation of seeing her words
made good. But at last the child, wearied with
its own importunities, fell asleep, and the poor
Wolf was forced to return back to the woods
empty and supperless. The Fox meeting him,

how he came to speed no better that night?&mdash;'Ah!

<p>All the moralists have agreed to interpret this

What reasons they could have for giving so rough

for, however fickle and unstable some
women may be, it is well known there are several
who have a greater regard for truth, in what they
assert or promise, than most men. There is not
room, in so short a compass, to express a due
concern for the honour of the ladies upon this
occasion, nor to show how much one is disposed
to vindicate them: and, though there is nothing
bad which can be said to them but may with
equal justice be averred of the other sex, yet
one would not venture to give them quite so
absolute a precaution as the old mythologists
have affixed to this fable; but only to advise
them to consider well and thoroughly of the
matter before they trust any man living.</p>

and away they both started together. But the
Hare, by reason of her exceeding swiftness,
outran the Tortoise to such a degree, that she
made a jest of the matter; and, finding herself a
little tired, squatted in a tuft of fern that grew by
the way, and took a nap; thinking that, if the
Tortoise went by, she could at any time fetch
him up with all the ease imaginable. In the meanwhile
the Tortoise came jogging on with slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
but continued motion; and the Hare, out of a
too great security and confidence of victory,
oversleeping herself, the Tortoise arrived at the
end of the race first.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Industry and application to business makes
amends for the want of a quick and ready wit.
Hence it is, that the victory is not always to the
strong, nor the race to the swift. Men of fine
parts are apt to despise the drudgery of business;
but, by affecting to show the superiority of their
genius, upon many occasions, they run into too
great an extreme the other way; and the administration
of their affairs is ruined through idleness
and neglect. What advantage has a man
from the fertility of his invention, and the
vivacity of his imagination, unless his resolutions
are executed with a suitable and uninterrupted
rapidity? In short, your men of wit and fire, as
they are called, are oftentimes sots, slovens, and
lazy fellows: they are generally proud and conceited
to the last degree; and, in the main, not
the fittest persons for either conversation or
business. Such is their vanity, they think the
sprightliness of their humour inconsistent with
a plain sober way of thinking and speaking, and
able to atone for all the little neglects of their
business and persons. But the world will not
be thus imposed upon; the man who would gain
the esteem of others, and make his own fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
must be one that carries his point effectually, and
finishes his course without swerving or loitering.
Men of dull parts, and a slow apprehension,
assisted by a continued diligence, are more likely
to attain this than your brisk retailers of wit,
with their affected spleen and indolence. And if
business be but well done, no matter whether it
be done by the sallies of a refined wit, or the
considering head of a plain plodding man.</p>

<p>A certain Young Man used to play with a Cat,
of which he grew so fond, that at last he fell in
love with it, and to such a degree, that he could
rest neither night nor day for the excess of his
passion. At last he prayed to Venus, the goddess
of beauty, to pity him, and relieve his pain. The
good-natured goddess was propitious, and heard
his prayers: before he rose up from kneeling, the
Cat, which he held in his arms, was transformed
into a beautiful girl. The Youth was transported
with joy, and married her that very day. At
night they went to bed, and as the new bride lay
encircled in the embraces of her amorous husband,
she unfortunately heard a Mouse behind the
hangings, and sprung from his arms to pursue it.
Venus, offended to see her sacred rites profaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by such an indecent behaviour, and perceiving
that her new convert, though a woman in outward
appearance, was a Cat in her heart, she made
her return to her old form again, that her manners
and person might be agreeable to each other.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>People, as to their manners and behaviour, take
a strong bias from custom and education, but a
much stronger from Nature. Her laws are so
strong, that it is in vain for us to go to oppose
them; we may refine and improve, but can never
totally alter her works. Upon this account it is
that we oftentimes see silly awkward blockheads
displaying their idiotism and folly through all
their ensigns of dignity; for some natures are so
coarse and rustic, that all the embroidery of a
court cannot conceal them. Doubtless such people
were intended by Nature for nothing above
driving Hogs to a fair, and laughing at the jokes
of a country Merry Andrew. Fortune has found
them worthy of her favours, and given them a
lift out of the mire: but yet they do not fail
to give frequent indications of their true composition,
by a thousand little dirty actions. A fine
equipage, and a great estate, may raise a man to
an exalted station, and procure a respect to his
outward person; notwithstanding which it may
so happen, that every time he speaks and acts he
cannot help playing the fool for the blood of him.</p>

<p>As all affectation is wrong, and tends to expose

may, by this means, meet the disgrace they intended
to avoid, and appear greater asses than
they need to have done. However, it is not in

expose themselves, by assuming a character to
which they are not equal; but he who puts on a
show of learning, of religion, of a superior capacity

weather. He took compassion on him, and
kindly invited him home to a warm comfortable
cave he had in the hollow of a rock. As soon as
they had entered and sat down, notwithstanding
there was a good fire in the place, the chilly
Traveller could not forbear blowing his fingers'
ends. Upon the Satyr's asking him why he did
so, he answered, that he did it to warm his hands.
The honest sylvan having seen little of the world,
admired a man who was master of so valuable a
quality as that of blowing heat, and therefore
was resolved to entertain him in the best manner
he could. He spread the table before him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
with dried fruits of several sorts; and produced
a remnant of cold cordial wine, which, as the
rigour of the season made very proper, he mulled
with some warm spices, infused over the fire,
and presented to his shivering guest. But this
the Traveller thought fit to blow likewise; and,
upon the Satyr's demanding a reason why he
blowed again, he replied, to cool his dish. This
second answer provoked the Satyr's indignation
as much as the first had kindled his surprise:
so, taking the man by the shoulder, he thrust
him out of doors, saying, he would have nothing
to do with a wretch who had so vile a quality as
to blow hot and cold with the same mouth.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Though the poor Traveller in the fable was
not guilty of any real crime in what he did, yet
one cannot help approving the honest simplicity
of the Satyr, who could not be reconciled to
such double dealing. In the moral sense of the
fable, nothing can be more offensive to one of a
sincere heart, than he that blows with a different
breath from the same mouth; who flatters
a man to his face, and reviles him behind his
back. Some again, just like this man, to serve
a present view, will blow nothing but what is
warm, benevolent, and cherishing; and, when
they have raised the expectations of a dependent
to a degree which they think may prove troublesome,
can, with putting on a cold air, easily chill
and blast all his blooming hopes. But such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
temper, whether it proceeds from a designed or
natural levity, is detestable, and has been the
cause of much trouble and mortification to many
a brave deserving man. Unless the tenor of a
man's life be always true and consistent with
itself, the less one has to do with him the better.</p>

<p>A Kite had been sick a long time, and finding

I have great reason to despair of doing you any
service in the way you propose: for, with what
face can I ask any thing of the gods in favour of

repentance. And, to expose the absurdity of
relying upon such a weak foundation, we need
only ask the same question with the Kite in the

his life-time, by doing acts of dishonour and
injustice, expect that they should be pleased with
him at last, for no other reason but because he
fears he shall not be able to offend them any

<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>They who neglect the opportunity of reaping
a small advantage, in hopes they shall obtain a
better, are far from acting upon a reasonable and
well-advised foundation. The figure of Time is
always drawn with a single lock of hair hanging
over his forehead, and the back part of his head
bald; to put us in mind that we should be sure
to lay hold of an occasion, when it presents itself
to us, lest afterwards we repent us of our omission
and folly, and would recover it when it is too
late. It is a very weak reason to give for our
refusal of an offer of kindness, that we do it
because we desire or deserve a better; for it is
time enough to relinquish the small affair when
the great one comes, if ever it does come. But,
supposing it should not, how can we forgive ourselves
for letting any thing slip through our hands,
by vainly gaping after something else, which we
never could obtain? He who has not been guilty
of any of these kind of errors, however poorly he
may come off at last, has only the malice of
fortune, or of somebody else, to charge with his
ill success; and may applaud himself with some
comfort, in never having lost an opportunity,
though ever so small, of bettering and improving
his circumstances. Unthinking people have oftentimes

<p>The Peacock presented a memorial to Juno,
importing how hardly he thought he was used in
not having so good a voice as the Nightingale;
how that pretty animal was agreeable to every
ear that heard it, while he was laughed at for his
ugly screaming noise, if he did but open his
mouth. The goddess, concerned at the uneasiness
of her favourite bird, answered him very kindly
to this purpose: 'If the Nightingale is blest
with a fine voice, you have the advantage in
point of beauty and largeness of person.'&mdash;'Ah!'
says he, 'but what avails my silent unmeaning
beauty, when I am so far excelled in voice!'&mdash;The
goddess dismissed him, bidding him consider,
that the properties of every creature were appointed
by the decree of fate: to him beauty;
strength to the Eagle; to the Nightingale a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
voice of melody; the faculty of speech to the
Parrot; and to the Dove innocence. That each
of these was contented with his own peculiar
quality; and unless he had a mind to be miserable,
he must learn to be so too.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Since all things, as Juno says, are fixed by the
eternal and unalterable decree of fate, how absurd
it is to hear people complaining and tormenting
themselves for that which it is impossible ever to
obtain! They who are ambitious of having more
good qualities, since that is impracticable, should
spare for no pains to cultivate and recommend
those they have; which a sourness and peevishness
of temper, instead of improving, will certainly
lessen and impair, whether they are of the mind
or body. If we had all the desirable properties
in the world, we could be no more than easy and
contented with them; and if a man, by a right
way of thinking, can reconcile himself to his own
condition, whatever it be, he will fall little short
of the most complete state that mortals ever
enjoyed.</p>

would instil into us is, never to let slip the present

advantage, just in the nick that it offers, without
a vain reliance upon, and fruitless expectation of,
something better in time to come. We may

<p>A flock of Geese and a parcel of Cranes
used often to feed together in a corn field. At
last the owner of the corn, with his servants,
coming upon them of a sudden, surprised them
in the very fact; and the geese, being heavy, fat,
full-bodied creatures, were most of them sufferers;
but the Cranes, being thin and light,
easily flew away.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>When the enemy comes to make a seizure,
they are sure to suffer most whose circumstances
are the richest and fattest. In any case of persecution,
money hangs like a dead weight about
a man; and we never feel gold so heavy as when
we endeavour to make off with it. Therefore
wise and politic ministers of state, whenever they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
see a storm begin to gather over their heads,
always take care to unlade themselves of a good
part of their cargo; and, by this means, seldom
find but the blasts of obloquy, through which they
are to make their way, are less deaf and inexorable
than the stormy waves of the ocean. Indeed,
poverty is too frequently the occasion of mens'
being treated as if they were guilty of the
greatest crimes and reproaches; but then these
sort of criminals have this advantage, that no one
thinks fit to treat them with any thing worse than
contempt: whereas if any pretence can be found
to fall upon the man who is rich, it is a miracle if
he escapes with both life and money. In short,
riches are like the baggage of an army: very
useful while we lie in quiet possession of the camp,
or are powerful enough to defy the enemy; but
when once we are put to the rout, if we would
get off with our lives or liberties, we must quit
our baggage as soon as possible, and leave it for
plunder to our pursuers. Nay, however strongly
intrenched we may think ourselves, as long as
money is in the case, it is good to look about us
for fear of a surprise: for, after all, he that does
not, upon occasion, make himself wings with his
riches to fly off with, deserves to be punished,
like a Goose as he is, for his heaviness.</p>

any thing his greedy design, that he dropped
the piece he had in his mouth, which immediately
sunk to the bottom, and was irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>He that catches at more than belongs to him

Great monarchs have been drawn in, by this
greedy humour, to grasp at the dominions of
their neighbours; not that they wanted any thing
more to feed their luxury, but to gratify their
insatiable appetite for vain-glory. If the kings
of Persia could have been contented with their
own vast territories, they had not lost all Asia
for the sake of a little petty state of Greece.

unjust encroachments.</p>

perceive, but skipping and frisking about, wagging
his tail, and leaping up into his master's
lap; he was resolved to imitate the same, and
see whether such a behaviour would not procure
him the same favours. Accordingly, the master
was no sooner come home from walking about
his fields and gardens, and was seated in his easy
chair, but the Ass, who observed him, came
gamboling and braying towards him, in a very
awkward manner. The master could not help
laughing aloud at the odd sight. But his jest
was soon turned into earnest, when he felt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
rough salute of the Ass's fore-feet, who, raising
himself upon his hinder legs, pawed against his
breast with a most loving air, and would fain
have jumped into his lap. The good man, terrified
at this outrageous behaviour, and unable to
endure the weight of so heavy a beast, cried out;
upon which, one of his servants running in with
a good stick, and laying on heartily upon the
bones of the poor Ass, soon convinced him that
every one who desires it is not qualified to be a
favourite.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Some men are as engaging in their ways as
little dogs. They can fawn, wheedle, cringe, or,
if occasion requires, leap backward and forward
over a stick, to the great emolument of their
master, and entertainment of those that behold
them. But these are qualifications to which every
body cannot pretend; and therefore none but
those who have a genius for it should aspire at the
employment. Many a man envies the happiness
of these favourites, and would fain insinuate himself
into the same good graces, if he did but know
the way; but, whoever has a tolerable share of
discretion, will distrust his abilities in this respect,
and modestly forbear the attempt, for fear he
should miscarry and look like an Ass. But, in
short, the true moral of this fable is, that every
one should consider the just turn and temper of
his parts, and weigh the talents by which he hopes
to be distinguished. After such an examination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
he may the more certainly know how to apply
them to the most proper purposes; at least, so as
not to hurt, or even mortify himself, by any mistaken
address. Since there is such a variety of
tempers in the world, and a no less multiplicity
of arts and studies to fit and tally with them, how
reasonable is it in general, and how much would
it be for the true interest of every one in particular,
if men would but be directed, by the
natural bent of their genius, to such pursuits as
are most agreeable to their capacities, and to the
rudiments of education which they have most
strongly imbibed.</p>

last the Crane, tempted with the lucre of the

that we ought to consider what kind of people
they are to whom we are desired to do good
offices, before we do them; for he that grants a

his commission, and withal told them that, to
make short of the matter, whatever the one asked
the other should have it double. Upon this, the
Covetous Man, though he had a thousand things
to request, yet forbore to ask first, hoping to
receive a double quantity; for he concluded that
all men's wishes sympathized with his. By this
means, the Envious Man had an opportunity of

<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>In this fable the folly of those two vices, Envy
and Avarice, is fully exposed, and handsomely
rallied. The Miser, though he has the riches of
the world, without stint, laid open to his choice,
yet dares not name the sum, for fear another
should be richer than himself. The advantage of
a double quantity, by receiving last, is what he
cannot bear to lose, and he fares accordingly.
The Envious Man, though he has a power of
calling for good things, without measure, to himself
or others, yet waves this happy privilege,
and is content to punish himself by a very great
loss, even that of an eye, that he may bring down
a double portion of the like calamity upon
another. These are the true tempers of the covetous
and envious; one can scarce determine,
whether they are more mischievous to themselves,

<p>The Fox invited the Stork to dinner, and being
disposed to divert himself at the expense of his
guest, provided nothing for the entertainment
but a soup, in a wide shallow dish. This himself
could lap up with a great deal of ease; but the
Stork, who could but just dip in the point of
his bill, was not a bit the better all the while:
however, in a few days after, he returned the
compliment, and invited the Fox; but suffered
nothing to be brought to table but some minced
meat in a glass jar, the neck of which was so deep,
and so narrow, that, though the Stork with his
long bill made a shift to fill his belly, all that the
Fox, who was very hungry, could do, was to lick
the brim, as the Stork slabbered them with his
eating. Reynard was heartily vexed at first;
but, when he came to take his leave, owned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
ingenuously, that he had been used as he deserved;
and that he had no reason to take any treatment
ill, of which himself had set the example.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>It is mighty imprudent, as well as inhuman and
uncivil, to affront any body; and whoever takes
the liberty to exercise his witty talent that way,
must not think much of it if he meets reprisals.
Indeed, if all those who are thus paid in their
own coin would take it with the same frankness
the Fox did, the matter would not be much;
but we are too apt, when the jest comes to be
turned home upon ourselves, to think that insufferable
in another, which we looked upon as
pretty and facetious when the humour was our
own. The rule of doing as we would be done
by, so proper to be our model in every transaction
of life, may more particularly be of use
in this respect: because people seldom or never
receive any advantage by these little ludicrous
impositions; and yet, if they were to ask themselves
the question, would find that another's
using them in the same manner would be very
displeasing.</p>

<p>A Bear, climbing over the fence into a place

Hives, and rob them of their honey. But the
Bees, to revenge the injury, attacked him in a
whole swarm together; and, though they were
not able to pierce his rugged hide, yet, with their
little stings, they so annoyed his eyes and nostrils,
that, unable to endure the smarting pain, with

They had not gone far before a Bear came rushing
towards them out of a thicket; upon which one,
being a light nimble fellow, got up into a tree;

his breath, lay still while the Bear came up and
smelled at him; but that creature, supposing him

all was over, the Spark who had climbed the

brushes one's ear with an unmeaning salute, and

by a well-timed assistance, though it were not
ushered in by previous compliments, will ever
after be looked upon as our friend and protector;

was unasked and unpromised; as it was not
extorted by importunities on the one side, nor

<p>A certain man, having taken a Partridge,
plucked some of the feathers out of its wings,

game Cocks. The Cocks, for awhile, made the
poor bird lead a sad life, continually pecking
and driving it away from the meat. This treatment
was taken the more unkindly, because
offered to a stranger; and the Partridge could
not but conclude them the most inhospitable
uncivil people he had ever met with. But at
last, observing how frequently they quarrelled
and fought with each other, he comforted himself
with this reflection; that it was no wonder
they were so cruel to him, since there was so much
bickering and animosity among themselves.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable comes home to ourselves, we of this
island having always been looked upon as cruel
to strangers. Whether there is any thing in the
manner of our situation, as an island, which consequently
can be no thoroughfare to other countries,
and so is not made use of by strangers upon
that account, which makes us thus shy and uncivil;
or, whether it be a jealousy upon account
of our liberties, which puts us upon being suspicious
of, and unwilling to harbour any that are
not members of the same community, perhaps it
would not be easy to determine. But that it is so
in fact, is too notorious to be denied; and probably
can be accounted for no better way than
from the natural bent of our temper, as it proceeds
from something peculiar to our air and climate.
It has been affirmed, that there is not in the
whole world besides a breed of Cocks and Dogs
so fierce and incapable of yielding as that of ours;
but that either of them, carried into foreign
countries, would degenerate in a few years. Why
may not the same be true of our men? But if
strangers find any inconvenience in this, there is
a comfortable consideration to balance it on the
other side, which is, that there are no people
under the sun so much given to division and
contention among themselves as we are. Can a
stranger think it hard to be looked upon with
some shyness, when he beholds how little we
spare one another? Was ever any foreigner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
merely for being a foreigner, treated with half
that malice and bitterness which differing parties
express towards each other? One would willingly
believe that this proceeds in the main, on both
sides, from a passionate concern for our liberties
and well-being; for there is nothing else which
can so well excuse it. But it cannot be denied,
that our aversion, notwithstanding our being a
trading nation, to have any intercourse with
strangers, is so great, that when we want other
objects for our churlishness, we raise them up
among ourselves; and there is, sometimes, as
great a strangeness kept up between one county
and another here, as there is between two distinct
kingdoms abroad. One cannot so much wonder
at the constant hostilities which are observed
between the inhabitants of South and North
Britain, of Wales and Ireland, among one another,
when a Yorkshireman shall be looked upon as a
foreigner by a native of Norfolk, and both be
taken for outlandish intruders by one that happens
to be born within the bills of mortality.</p>

replies the Falconer, 'I was before determined

And accordingly history furnishes us with many
instances of kings and great men who have
punished the actors of treachery with death,
though the part they acted had been so conducive
to their interests as to give them a victory, or
perhaps the quiet possession of a throne. Nor
can princes pursue a more just maxim than this;
for a traitor is a villain of no principles, that
sticks at nothing to promote his own selfish
ends; he that betrays one cause for a great sum
of money, will betray another upon the same
account; and therefore it must be very impolitic
in a state to suffer such wretches to live in it.
Since then this maxim is so good, and so likely
at all times to be practised, what stupid rogues
must they be who undertake such precarious
dirty work! If they miscarry, it generally proves
fatal to them from one side or other; if they
succeed, perhaps they may have the promised
reward, but are sure to be detested, if suffered to
live, by the very person that employs them.</p>

<p>A prodigal Young Spendthrift, who had
wasted his whole patrimony in taverns and gaming-houses,
among lewd idle company, was taking
a melancholy walk near a brook. It was in the
month of January; and happened to be one of
those warm sunshiny days which sometimes smile
upon us even in that winterly season of the year;
and, to make it the more flattering, a Swallow,
which had made his appearance, by mistake, too
soon, flew skimming along upon the surface of
the water. The giddy Youth observing this,
without any further consideration, concluded that
summer was now come, and that he should have
little or no occasion for clothes, so went and
pawned them at the broker's, and ventured the
money for one stake more, among his sharping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
companions. When this too was gone the same
way with the rest, he took another solitary walk
in the same place as before. But the weather
being severe and frosty, had made every thing
look with an aspect very different from what it
did before; the brook was quite frozen over, and
the poor Swallow lay dead upon the bank of it:
the very sight of which cooled the young Spark's
brains; and coming to a kind of sense of his
misery, he reproached the deceased bird as the
author of all his misfortunes:&mdash;'Ah, wretch that
thou wert!' says he, 'thou hast undone both thyself
and me, who was so credulous as to depend

<p>They who frequent taverns and gaming-houses,
and keep bad company, should not wonder if
they are reduced, in a very small time, to penury

once addict themselves to such a scandalous kind
of life, scarce think of, or attend to, any one thing
besides. They seem to have nothing else in their
heads, but how they may squander what they have
got, and where they may get more when that is
gone. They do not make the same use of their
reason that other people do; but, like the jaundiced
eye, view every thing in that false light in
which their distemper and debauchery represent
it. The Young Man in the fable gives us a pretty
example of this; he sees a Swallow in the midst
of winter, and instead of being surprised at it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
as a very irregular and extraordinary thing, concludes
from thence that it is summer, as if he had
never thought before about the season. Well,
the result of this wise conclusion is of a piece
with the conclusion itself; if it is summer, he
shall not want so many clothes, therefore he sells
them: for what?&mdash;More money to squander away;
as if (had his observation been just) summer
would have lasted all the year round. But the
true result and conclusion of all this is&mdash;when
both his money and clothes are irrecoverably
gone, he comes to his right senses; is ready to
perish with hunger, to starve with cold, and to
tear his own flesh with remorse and vexation at

<p>They who are of such craving impatient tempers,
that they cannot live contented when fortune
has blessed them with a constant and continued
sufficiency, deserve even to be deprived of what
they have. And this has been the case of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
ambitious and covetous men, who, by making an
essay to grow very rich at once, have missed
what they aimed at, and lost what they had before.
But this comes so near the sense of the forty-seventh
fable, that the same application may
very well serve for both. If any thing further can
be couched in this, it may possibly be intended to
show us the unreasonableness and inconvenience
of being solicitous about what may happen hereafter,
and wanting to pry into the womb of
futurity: which if we could do, all we should get
for our pains would be, to spoil our pleasures by
anticipation, and double our misfortunes by a
previous sense and apprehension of them. There
are some things that entertain and delight us very
agreeably while we view them at a proper distance;
which, perhaps, would not stand the test
of a too near inspection. Beauty, being only the
external form of a thing which strikes the eye in
a pleasing manner, is a very thin glossy being,
and, like some nice paintings of a peculiar composition,
will not well bear even to be breathed
on: to preserve our good opinion of it, we must
not approach too close; for if, like the man in
the fable, we have a mind to search for a treasure
within, we may not only fail of our expectations
there, but even lose the constant relish we
enjoyed from a remoter contemplation.</p>

you may live as well, if you will do the

the Wolf spied a crease in the Dog's neck,

'Why,' says the Dog, 'if you must know, I

faint under his heavy load, entreated the Horse
to assist him, and lighten his burden, by taking
some of it upon his back. The Horse was ill-natured,
and refused to do it; upon which the
poor Ass tumbled down in the midst of the highway,
and expired in an instant. The countryman
ungirted his pack-saddle, and tried several ways
to relieve him, but all to no purpose: which,
when he perceived, he took the whole burden
and laid it upon the Horse, together with the
skin of the dead Ass: so that the Horse, by his
moroseness in refusing to do a small kindness,
justly brought upon himself a great inconvenience.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Self-love is no such ill principle, if it were but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
well and truly directed; for it is impossible that
any man should love himself to any purpose, who
withdraws his assistance from his friends or the
public. Every government is to be considered
as a body politic; and every man who lives in it
as a member of that body. Now, to carry on the
allegory, no member can thrive better than when
they all jointly unite in their endeavours to assist
and improve the whole. If the hand was to
refuse its assistance in procuring food for the
mouth, they must both starve and perish together.
And when those, who are parties concerned in
the same community, deny such assistance to
each other, as the preservation of that community
necessarily requires, their self-interestedness, in
that case, is ill-directed, and will have a quite
contrary effect from what they intended. How
many people are so senseless as to think it hard
that there should be any taxes in the nation;
whereas, were there to be none indeed, those
very people would be undone immediately. That
little property they have would be presently
plundered by foreign or domestic enemies; and
then they would be glad to contribute their quota,
even without an act of parliament. The charges
of supporting a government are necessary things,
and easily supplied by a due and well proportioned
contribution. But, in a narrower and
more confined view, to be ready to assist our
friends upon all occasions, is not only good, as
it is an act of humanity, but highly discreet, as
it strengthens our interest, and gives us an
opportunity of lightening the burden of life.</p>

<p>A poor feeble old man who had crawled out
into a neighbouring wood to gather a few sticks,
had made up his bundle, and, laying it over his
shoulders was trudging homeward with it; but,
what with age, and the length of the way, and
the weight of his burden, he grew so faint and
weak that he sunk under it: and, as he sat on
the ground, called upon Death to come, once
for all, and ease him of his troubles. Death no
sooner heard him, but he came and demanded of
him what he wanted. The poor old creature,
who little thought Death had been so near,
and frighted almost out of his senses with his
terrible aspect, answered him trembling, that
having by chance let his bundle of sticks fall,
and being too infirm to get it up himself, he had
made bold to call upon him to help him: that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
indeed, this was all he wanted at present; and
that he hoped his worship was not offended with
him for the liberty he had taken in so doing.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>This fable gives us a lively representation of
the general behaviour of mankind towards that
grim king of terrors, Death. Such liberties do
they take with him behind his back, that, upon
every little cross accident which happens in their
way, Death is immediately called upon; and
they even wish it might be lawful for them to
finish by their own hands a life so odious, so
perpetually tormenting and vexatious. When,
let but Death only offer to make his appearance,
and the very sense of his near approach almost
does the business. Oh, then all they want is a
little longer life; and they would be glad to come
off so well as to have their old burden laid upon
their shoulders again. One may well conclude
what an utter aversion they, who are in youth,
health, and vigour of body, have to dying, when
age, poverty, and wretchedness, are not sufficient
to reconcile us to the thought.</p>

Buffoons, like dwarfs, should be matched with
those of their own level; a man, in sense or
stature, would be ashamed to encounter either
of them. But notwithstanding all this, and
though the Boar in the fable is a very good
example to men of generous brave spirits not to
give themselves up to passion, nor to be distempered
with thoughts of revenge upon the
insolent behaviour of every Ass that offends
them, because their hands would be dishonoured
by the tincture of a base man's blood; yet among
human creatures, the correction of an Ass that
would be unseasonably witty, may be performed
with justness and propriety enough, provided
it be done in good humour. The blood of a
coward, literally speaking, would stain the character
of a man of honour; when we chastise

he was alarmed with the noise of some huntsmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and a pack of hounds that had been just laid on
upon the scent, and were making towards him.
Away he flies, in some consternation, and, bounding
nimbly over the plain, threw dogs and men
at a vast distance behind him. After which,
taking a very thick copse, he had the ill-fortune
to be entangled by his horns in a thicket; where
he was held fast till the hounds came in and
pulled him down. Finding now how it was like
to go with him, in the pangs of death he is said to
have uttered these words:&mdash;'Unhappy creature
that I am! I am too late convinced, that what I
prided myself in has been the cause of my undoing,
and what I so much disliked was the only
thing that could have saved me.'</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Perhaps we cannot apply this better than by
supposing the fable to be a parable! which may
be thus explained. The Deer, viewing itself in
the water, is a beautiful young lady at her looking-glass.
She cannot help being sensible of the
charms which lie blooming in every feature of her
face. She moistens her lips, languishes with her
eyes, adjusts every lock of her hair with the nicest
exactness, gives an agreeable attitude to her whole
body; and then, with a soft sigh, says to herself,&mdash;'Ah!
how happy might I be, in a daily crowd
of admirers, if it were not for the censoriousness
of the age! when I view that face, where Nature,
to give her her due, has been liberal enough of
charms, how easy should I be, if it were not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that slender particular, my honour. The odious
idea of that comes across all my happy moments,
and brings a mortification with it that damps my
most flattering tender hopes. Oh! that there
were no such thing in the world!'&mdash;In the midst
of these soliloquies she is interrupted by the
voice of her lover, who enters her chamber singing
a rigadoon air; and, introducing his discourse
in a familiar easy manner, takes occasion
to launch out in praise of her beauty; sees she
is pleased with it, snatches her hand, kisses it in
a transport; and, in short, pursues his point so
close, that she is not able to disengage herself
from him. But, when the consequence of all
this approaches, in an agony of grief and shame,
she fetches a deep sigh and says&mdash;'Ah! how
mistaken have I been! the virtue I slighted might
have saved me; but the beauty I prized so much
has been my undoing.'</p>

<span class="caption">THE STAG AND THE OX-STALL.</span>
</div>


<p>A Stag, roused out of his thick cover in the
midst of the forest, and driven hard by the
hounds, made towards a farm-house, and seeing
the door of an Ox-Stall open, entered therein,
and hid himself under a heap of straw. One of
the Oxen, turning his head about, asked him
what he meant by venturing himself in such a
place as that was, where he was sure to meet
with his doom?&mdash;'Ah!' says the Stag, 'if you
will but be so good as to favour me with your
concealment, I hope I shall do well enough; I
intend to make off again the first opportunity.'&mdash;Well,
he staid there till towards night; in
came the ox-man with a bundle of fodder, and
never saw him. In short, all the servants of the
farm came and went, and not a soul of them smelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
any thing of the matter. Nay, the bailiff himself
came according to form, and looked in, but
walked away no wiser than the rest. Upon this
the Stag, ready to jump out of his skin for joy,
began to return thanks to the good-natured
Oxen, protesting that they were the most obliging
people he had ever met with in his life. After he
had done his compliments, one of them answered
him gravely&mdash;'Indeed, we desire nothing more
than to have it in our power to contribute to
your escape; but there is a certain person, you
little think of, who has a hundred eyes; if he
should happen to come, I would not give this
straw for your life.'&mdash;In the interim, home comes
the master himself, from a neighbour's, where he
had been invited to dinner; and, because he had
observed the cattle to look but scurvily of late,
he went up to the rack, and asked, why they did
not give them more fodder? then, casting his
eyes downward,&mdash;'Hey-day!' says he, 'why so
sparing of your litter? pray scatter a little more
here. And these cobwebs&mdash;but I have spoke so
often, that unless I do it myself&mdash;' Thus, as he
went on, prying into every thing, he chanced to
look where the Stag's horns lay sticking out of
the straw; upon which he raised a hue-and-cry,
called all his people about him, killed the poor
Stag, and made a prize of him.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>The moral of this fable is, that nobody looks
after a man's affairs so well as he himself. Servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
being but hirelings, seldom have the true
interest of their master at heart, but let things
run on in a negligent constant disorder; and this,
generally, not so much for want of capacity as
honesty. Their heads are taken up with the cultivation
of their own private interest; for the service
and promotion of which that of their master
is postponed, and often entirely neglected.</p>

<p>Few families are reduced to poverty and distress
merely by their own extravagance and indulgence
in luxury: the inattention of servants swells
every article of expense in domestic &oelig;conomy;
and the retinue of great men, instead of exerting
their industry to conduce as far as possible to
the increase of their master's wealth, commonly
exercise no other office than that of locusts and
caterpillars, to consume and devour it.</p>

<span class="caption">THE DOVE AND THE ANT.</span>
</div>


<p>The Ant, compelled by thirst, went to drink in
a clear purling rivulet; but the current, with its
circling eddy, snatched her away, and carried
her down the stream. The Dove, pitying her
distressed condition, cropped a branch from a
neighbouring tree, and let it fall into the water,
by means of which the Ant saved herself, and
got ashore. Not long after, a fowler having a
design upon the Dove, planted his nets in due
order, without the bird's observing what he was
about; which the Ant perceiving, just as he was
going to put his design in execution, she bit
him by the heel, and made him give so sudden
a start, that the Dove took the alarm, and flew
away.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>APPLICATION.</p>

<p>One good turn deserves another; and gratitude
is excited by so noble and natural a spirit, that he
ought to be looked upon as the vilest of creatures
who has no sense of it. It is, indeed, so very just
and equitable a thing, and so much every man's
duty, that, to speak of it properly, one should not
mention it as any thing meritorious, or that may
claim praise and admiration, any more than we
should say a man ought to be rewarded or commended
for not killing his father, or forbearing
to set fire to his neighbour's house. The bright
and shining piece of morality, therefore, which
is recommended to us in this fable, is set forth
in this example of the Dove, who, without any
obligation or expectation, does a voluntary office
of charity to its fellow creature in distress. The
constant uninterrupted practice of this virtue, is
the only thing in which we are capable of imitating
the great Author of our being; whose
beloved Son, besides the many precepts he has
given to enforce this duty, used this expression
as a common saying, 'It is more blessed to give
than to receive.'</p>

<img src="images/i_269.jpg" width="450" height="316" alt="THE LION IN LOVE." title="THE LION IN LOVE." />
<span class="caption">THE LION IN LOVE.</span>
</div>


<p>The Lion, by chance, saw a fair Maid, the
forester's daughter, as she was tripping over a
lawn, and fell in love with her. Nay, so violent
was his passion, that he could not live unless he
made her his own; so that, without any more
delay, he broke his mind to the father, and demanded
the damsel for his wife. The man, as
odd as the proposal seemed at first, yet soon
recollected, that by complying he might get the
Lion into his power; but, by refusing him,
should only exasperate and provoke his rage.
Therefore he consented; but told him it must be
upon these conditions: that, considering the girl
was young and tender, he must agree to let his
teeth be plucked out, and his claws cut off, lest
he should hurt her, or at least frighten her, with
the apprehension of them. The Lion was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
much in love to hesitate; but was no sooner
deprived of his teeth and claws, than the treacherous
forester attacked him with a huge club, and
knocked his brains out.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>Of all the ill consequences that may attend
that blind passion, love, seldom any prove so
fatal as that one, of its drawing people into a
sudden and ill-concerted marriage. They commit
a rash action in the midst of a fit of madness,
of which, as soon as they come to themselves,
they may find reason to repent as long as they
live. Many an unthinking young fellow has been
treated as much like a savage, in this respect, as
the Lion in the fable. He has, perhaps, had
nothing valuable belonging to him but his estate,
and the writings which made his title to it; and,
if he is so far captivated as to be persuaded to
part with these, his teeth and his claws are gone,
and he lies entirely at the mercy of madam and
her relations. All the favour he is to expect, after
this, is from the accidental goodness of the family
he falls into; which, if it happen to be of a particular
strain, will not fail to keep him in a distant
subjection, after they have stripped him of all his
power. Nothing but a true friendship, and a
mutual interest, can keep up reciprocal love
between the conjugal pair; and when that is
wanting, and nothing but contempt and aversion
remain to supply the place, matrimony becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
a downright state of enmity and hostility: and
what a miserable case he must be in, who has put
himself and his whole power into the hands of his
enemy, let those consider, who, while they are in
their sober senses, abhor the thoughts of being
betrayed into their ruin, by following the impulse
of a blind unheeding passion.</p>

<span class="caption">THE TORTOISE AND THE EAGLE.</span>
</div>


<p>The Tortoise, weary of his condition, by which
he was confined to creep upon the ground, and
being ambitious to have a prospect, and look
about him, gave out, that if any bird would take
him up into the air, and show him the world, he
would reward him with a discovery of many
precious stones, which he knew were hidden in a
certain place of the earth: the Eagle undertook
to do as he desired, and, when he had performed
his commission, demanded the reward; but finding
the Tortoise could not make good his words,
he stuck his talons into the softer parts of his
body, and made him a sacrifice to his revenge.</p>


<p class="center">APPLICATION.</p>

<p>As men of honour ought to consider calmly
how far the things which they promise may be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
their power, before they venture to make promises
upon this account, because the non-performance
of them will be apt to excite an uneasiness within
themselves, and tarnish their reputation in the
eyes of other people; so fools and cowards should
be as little rash in this respect as possible, lest
their impudent forgeries draw upon them the
resentment of those whom they disappoint, and
that resentment makes them undergo smart, but
deserved, chastisement. The man who is so
stupid a knave as to make a lying promise where
he is sure to be detected, receives the punishment
of his folly unpitied by all that know him.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
